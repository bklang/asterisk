* EVERYTHING MARKED WITH "XXX" IN THE SOURCE REPRESENTS A BUG!  Sometimes
  these bugs are in asterisk, and sometimes they relate to the products
  that asterisk uses.

* In general Asterisk is a very new program, and there are liable to be
  many bugs yet to be discovered, so if you think you've found one, please
  be sure to report it.

* When you flip to call waiting on a tormenta channel while you have a
  three way call up, the parties in the three way cannot hear one another
  in the general case.
