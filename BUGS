* EVERYTHING MARKED WITH "XXX" IN THE SOURCE REPRESENTS A BUG!  Sometimes
  these bugs are in asterisk, and sometimes they relate to the products
  that asterisk uses.

* The translator API may introduce warble in the case of going in both
  directions, but I haven't verified that.  The trouble should only enter
  in the case of mismatched frame lengths.

* In general Asterisk is a very new program, and there are liable to be
  many bugs yet to be discovered, so if you think you've found one, please
  be sure to report it.
