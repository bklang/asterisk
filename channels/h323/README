Notice: Whatever you do, DO NOT USE distrubution specific installs
of Open H.323 and PWLib. Check everything out of CVS. If you dont know
how to deal with cvs, learn. Also, if you are not using the listed
versions of Open H.323 or PWlib you are on your own, sorry. Older versions
will NOT work, but newer versions ~should~ work.

We have implemented this driver using Asterisk's RTP stack insted of trying
to implement a psudo sound card driver. 
 
If you have trouble please contact 'JerJer' in #Asterisk on irc.freenode.net or
send and email to jj@indie.org

If you happen to be lucky enough to segfault this code please run a backtrace 
and send me the gory details. Segmentation faults are not tolerated!

bt example:

# /usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvgc
...
[chan_h323.so]
Segmentation Fault (core dumped)

# ls core.*
core.1976

# gdb /usr/sbin/asterisk core.1976
...
(gdb) bt

Send whatever shows up right after the 'bt'


Also, a full debug screen output is almost needed. Make sure you are in the full console mode (-c) and turn on 'h.323 
debug'. A nice way to capture everything is to use the utility called 'script' (man script)
