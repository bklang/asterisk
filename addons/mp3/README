This is a module for asterisk to play mp3 natively.
They *SHOULD* be already at 8khz and *SHOULD* be mono.
otherwise they will be consuming CPU alot more than need be.

Convert them to 8k mono like this:
lame -q -p --mp3input -a --preset 8 in.mp3 8kout.mp3

just run 
# make clean install 
to install 

or
# make clean autoload
to install and autoload at the same time
