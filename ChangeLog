	* many files: alphabetize options in applicaiton descriptions
	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Use an enum to define iax peer/user flags as well as the pvt structure state.  Use the ast_flags macros for checking or setting the state.
	* sounds.txt: Add missing words from the description of the vm-opts prompt
	* apps/app_externalivr.c: Add a space that fixes building on older versions of gcc
	* many files: Add doxygen updates to categorize modules into groups. Convert a lot of comments over to doxygen style. Add some text giving a basic overview of channels.
	* apps/app_chanisavail.c: Make priority jumping optional
	* apps/app_db.c: Add an exit status variable and make priority jumping optional
	* apps/app_enumlookup.c: Make priority jumping optional
	* apps/app_groupcount.c: Add an exit status variable, make priority jumping optional, and use new args parsing macros

	* Makefile: don't rebuild asterisk/build.h unless the asterisk binary is going to be relinked for some other reason (stops spurious recompile/link every time 'make' is issued); clean up variable substitutions to use consistent syntax
	* asterisk.c: don't include asterisk/build.h (it's unnecessary)
	* cli.c: don't include asterisk/build.h, use extern references to buildinfo.c
	* buildinfo.c: new file to hold version info strings

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Create a function that stores a peer's status in a given buffer.  Use this function in "iax2 show peers" and "iax2 show peer <peername>".  Also, add the peer's status as an option to the IAXPEER dialplan function.
