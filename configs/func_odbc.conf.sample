; Each context is a separately defined function.  By convention, all
; functions are entirely uppercase, so the defined contexts should also
; be all-uppercase, but there is nothing that enforces this.  All functions
; are case-sensitive, however.
;
; For substitution, you have ${ARG1}, ${ARG2} ... ${ARGn}
; for the arguments to each SQL statement.
;
; In addition, for write statements, you have ${VAL1}, ${VAL2} ... ${VALn}
; parsed, just like arguments, for the values.  In addition, if you want the
; whole value, never mind the parsing, you can get that with ${VALUE}.
