; Any modules that need to be loaded before the Asterisk core has been
; initialized (just after the logger has been initialized) can be loaded
; using 'preload'. This will frequently be needed if you wish to map all
; module configuration files into Realtime storage, since the Realtime
; driver will need to be loaded before the modules using those configuration
; files are initialized.
;
; An example of loading ODBC support would be:
;preload => res_odbc.so
;preload => res_config_odbc.so
;
; If you want, load the GTK console right away.  
; Don't load the KDE console since
; it's not as sophisticated right now.

; Intercom application is obsoleted by
; chan_oss.  Don't load it.

; The 'modem' channel driver and its subdrivers are
; obsolete, don't load them.

; By default, load OSS only (automatically) and do not load ALSA
