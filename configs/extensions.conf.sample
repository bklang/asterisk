; You can include other config files, use the #include command (without the ';')
; Note that this is different from the "include" command that includes contexts within 
; other contexts. The #include command works in all asterisk configuration files.
;#include "filename.conf"

; The "Globals" category contains global variables that can be referenced
; in the dialplan with ${VARIABLE} or ${ENV(VARIABLE)} for Environmental variable
; ${${VARIABLE}} or ${text${VARIABLE}} or any hybrid
;
[globals]
CONSOLE=Console/dsp				; Console interface for demo
;CONSOLE=Zap/1
;CONSOLE=Phone/phone0
IAXINFO=guest					; IAXtel username/password
;IAXINFO=myuser:mypass
TRUNK=Zap/g2					; Trunk interface
TRUNKMSD=1					; MSD digits to strip (usually 1 or 0)
;TRUNK=IAX2/user:pass@provider

;
; Any category other than "General" and "Globals" represent 
; extension contexts, which are collections of extensions.  
;
; Extension names may be numbers, letters, or combinations
; thereof. If an extension name is prefixed by a '_'
; character, it is interpreted as a pattern rather than a
; literal.  In patterns, some characters have special meanings:
;
;   X - any digit from 0-9
;   Z - any digit from 1-9
;   N - any digit from 2-9
;   [1235-9] - any digit in the brackets (in this example, 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9)
;   . - wildcard, matches anything remaining (e.g. _9011. matches 
;	anything starting with 9011 excluding 9011 itself)
;
; For example the extension _NXXXXXX would match normal 7 digit dialings, 
; while _1NXXNXXXXXX would represent an area code plus phone number
; preceeded by a one.
;
; Each step of an extension is ordered by priority, which must
; always start with 1 to be considered a valid extension.  The priority
; "next" or "n" means the previous priority plus one, regardless of whether
; the previous priority was associated with the current extension or not.
; The priority "same" or "s" means the same as the previously specified
; priority, again regardless of whether the previous entry was for the
; same extension.  Priorities may also have an alias, or label, in 
; parenthesis after their name which can be used in goto situations
;
; Contexts contain several lines, one for each step of each
; extension, which can take one of two forms as listed below,
; with the first form being preferred.  One may include another
; context in the current one as well, optionally with a
; date and time.  Included contexts are included in the order
; they are listed.
