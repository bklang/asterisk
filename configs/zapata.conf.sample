[trunkgroups]
;
; Trunk groups are used for NFAS or GR-303 connections.
;
; Group: Defines a trunk group.  
;        group => <trunkgroup>,<dchannel>[,<backup1>...]
;
;        trunkgroup  is the numerical trunk group to create
;        dchannel    is the zap channel which will have the 
;                    d-channel for the trunk.
;        backup1     is an optional list of backup d-channels.
;
;trunkgroup => 1,24,48
;
; Spanmap: Associates a span with a trunk group
;        spanmap => <zapspan>,<trunkgroup>[,<logicalspan>]
;
;        zapspan     is the zap span number to associate
;        trunkgroup  is the trunkgroup (specified above) for the mapping
;        logicalspan is the logical span number within the trunk group to use.
;                    if unspecified, no logical span number is used.

;
; Stutter dialtone support: If a mailbox is specified without a voicemail 
; context, then when voicemail is received in a mailbox in the default 
; voicemail context in voicemail.conf, taking the phone off hook will 
; cause a stutter dialtone instead of a normal one. 
;
; If a mailbox is specified *with* a voicemail context, the same will 
; result if voicemail recieved in mailbox in the specified voicemail 
; context
;
; for default voicemail context, the example below is fine:
;
;mailbox=1234
;
; for any other voicemail context, the following will produce the 
; stutter tone:
;
;mailbox=1234@context 
;
; Enable echo cancellation 
; Use either "yes", "no", or a power of two from 32 to 256 if you wish
; to actually set the number of taps of cancellation.
;
echocancel=yes
;
; Generally, it is not necessary (and in fact undesirable) to echo cancel
; when the circuit path is entirely TDM.  You may, however, reverse this
; behavior by enabling the echo cancel during pure TDM bridging below.
;
echocancelwhenbridged=yes
;
; In some cases, the echo canceller doesn't train quickly enough and there
; is echo at the beginning of the call.  Enabling echo training will cause
; asterisk to briefly mute the channel, send an impulse, and use the impulse
; response to pre-train the echo canceller so it can start out with a much
; closer idea of the actual echo.
;
;echotraining=yes
;
; If you are having trouble with DTMF detection, you can relax the
; DTMF detection parameters.  Relaxing them may make the DTMF detector
; more likely to have "talkoff" where DTMF is detected when it
; shouldn't be.
;
;relaxdtmf=yes
;
; You may also set the default receive and transmit gains (in dB)
;

; Logical groups can be assigned to allow outgoing rollover.  Groups
; range from 0 to 31, and multiple groups can be specified.

;
; Ring groups (a.k.a. call groups) and pickup groups.  If a phone is ringing
; and it is a member of a group which is one of your pickup groups, then
; you can answer it by picking up and dialing *8#.  For simple offices, just
; make these both the same
;

;
; Specify whether the channel should be answered immediately or
; if the simple switch should provide dialtone, read digits, etc.
;

;
; CallerID can be set to "asreceived" or a specific number
; if you want to override it.  Note that "asreceived" only
; applies to trunk interfaces.

;
; ADSI (Analog Display Services Interface) can be enabled on a per-channel
; basis if you have (or may have) ADSI compatible CPE equipment
;
;adsi=yes
;
; On trunk interfaces (FXS) and E&M interfaces (E&M, Wink, Feature Group D
; etc, it can be useful to perform busy detection either in an effort to 
; detect hangup or for detecting busies
;
;busydetect=yes
;
; If busydetect is enabled, is also possible to specify how many
; busy tones to wait before hanging up. The default is 4, but
; better results can be achieved if set to 6 or even 8. Mind that
; higher the number, more time is needed to hangup a channel, but
; lower is probability to get random hangups
;
;busycount=4
;
; On trunk interfaces (FXS) it can be useful to attempt to follow the progress
; of a call through RINGING, BUSY, and ANSWERING.   If turned on, call
; progress attempts to determine answer, busy, and ringing on phone lines.
; This feature is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and can easily detect false answers,
; so don't count on it being very accurate.  
;
; Few zones are supported at the time of this writing, but may
; be selected with "progzone"
;
; This feature can also easily detect false hangups. The symptoms of this 
; is being disconnected in the middle of a call for no reason.
;
;callprogress=yes
;progzone=us
;
; For fax detection, uncomment one of the following lines.  The default is *OFF*
;
;faxdetect=both
;faxdetect=incoming
;faxdetect=outgoing

;
; Select which class of music to use for music on hold.  If not specified
; then the default will be used.
;
;musiconhold=default
;
; PRI channels can have an idle extension and a minunused number.  So long
; as at least "minunused" channels are idle, chan_zap will try to call
; "idledial" on them, and then dump them into the PBX in the "idleext"
; extension (which is of the form exten@context).  When channels are needed
; the "idle" calls are disconnected (so long as there are at least "minidle"
; calls still running, of course) to make more channels available.  The
; primary use of this is to create a dynamic service, where idle channels
; are bundled through multilink PPP, thus more efficiently utilizing
; combined voice/data services than conventional fixed mappings/muxings.
;

;
; Configure jitter buffers in zapata (each one is 20ms, default is 4)
;
;jitterbuffers=4
;
; You can define your own custom ring cadences here.  You can define up to
; 8 pairs.  If the silence is negative, it indicates where the callerid
; spill is to be placed.  Also, if you define any custom cadences, the
; default cadences will be turned off.
;
; Syntax is:  cadence=ring,silence[,ring,silence[...]]
;
; These are the default cadences:
;
;cadence=125,125,2000,-4000
;cadence=250,250,500,1000,250,250,500,-4000

;
; Each channel consists of the channel number or range.  It
; inherits the parameters that were specified above its declaration
;
; For GR-303, CRV's are created like channels except they must start
; with the trunk group followed by a colon, e.g.: 
;
