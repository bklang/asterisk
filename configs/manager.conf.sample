;
; AMI - The Asterisk Manager Interface
; 
; Third party application call management support and PBX event supervision
;
; This configuration file is read every time someone logs in
;
; Use the "show manager commands" at the CLI to list available manager commands
; and their authorization levels.
;
; "show manager command <command>" will show a help text.
;
; ---------------------------- SECURITY NOTE -------------------------------
; Note that you should not enable the AMI on a public IP address. If needed,
; block this TCP port with iptables (or another FW software) and reach it
; with IPsec, SSH, or SSL vpn tunnel.  You can also make the manager 
; interface available over http if Asterisk's http server is enabled in
; http.conf and if both "enabled" and "webenabled" are set to yes in
; this file.  Both default to no.  httptimeout provides the maximum 
; timeout in seconds before a web based session is discarded.  The 
; default is 60 seconds.
