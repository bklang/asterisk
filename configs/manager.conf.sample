;
; AMI - The Asterisk Manager Interface
; 
; Third party application call management support and PBX event supervision
;
; This configuration file is read every time someone logs in
;
; Use the "manager show commands" at the CLI to list available manager commands
; and their authorization levels.
;
; "manager show command <command>" will show a help text.
;
; ---------------------------- SECURITY NOTE -------------------------------
; Note that you should not enable the AMI on a public IP address. If needed,
; block this TCP port with iptables (or another FW software) and reach it
; with IPsec, SSH, or SSL vpn tunnel.  You can also make the manager 
; interface available over http/https if Asterisk's http server is enabled in
; http.conf and if both "enabled" and "webenabled" are set to yes in
; this file.  Both default to no.  httptimeout provides the maximum 
; timeout in seconds before a web based session is discarded.  The 
; default is 60 seconds.
;
[general]
enabled = no
;webenabled = yes
port = 5038

;httptimeout = 60
; a) httptimeout sets the Max-Age of the http cookie
; b) httptimeout is the amount of time the webserver waits 
;    on a action=waitevent request (actually its httptimeout-10)
; c) httptimeout is also the amount of time the webserver keeps 
;    a http session alive after completing a successful action

bindaddr = 0.0.0.0

; Parameters that control AMI over TLS. ("enabled" must be set too).
; You can open a connection to this socket with e.g.
;
;	openssl s_client -connect my_host:5039
;
;tlsenable=no		; set to YES to enable it
;tlsbindport=5039		; the port to bind to
;tlsbindaddr=0.0.0.0		; address to bind to, default to bindaddr
;tlscertfile=/tmp/asterisk.pem	; path to the certificate.
;tlsprivatekey=/tmp/private.pem ; path to the private key, if no private given,
; if no tlsprivatekey is given, default is to search
; tlscertfile for private key.
;tlscipher=<cipher string>      ; string specifying which SSL ciphers to use or not use
;
;allowmultiplelogin = yes		; IF set to no, rejects manager logins that are already in use.
;                               ; The default is yes.
;
;displayconnects = yes
;
; Add a Unix epoch timestamp to events (not action responses)
;
;timestampevents = yes

; debug = on	; enable some debugging info in AMI messages (default off).
; Also accessible through the "manager debug" CLI command.

;secret = mysecret
;deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
;permit=209.16.236.73/255.255.255.0

; If the device connected via this user accepts input slowly,
; the timeout for writes to it can be increased to keep it
; from being disconnected (value is in milliseconds)

;
; Authorization for various classes 
;
; Read authorization permits you to receive asynchronous events, in general.
; Write authorization permits you to send commands and get back responses.  The
; following classes exist:
;
; system    - General information about the system and ability to run system
;             management commands, such as Shutdown, Restart, and Reload.
; call      - Information about channels and ability to set information in a
;             running channel.
; log       - Logging information.  Read-only.
; verbose   - Verbose information.  Read-only.
; agent     - Information about queues and agents and ability to add queue
;             members to a queue.
; user      - Permission to send and receive UserEvent.
; config    - Ability to read and write configuration files.
; command   - Permission to run CLI commands.  Write-only.
; dtmf      - Receive DTMF events.  Read-only.
; reporting - Ability to get information about the system.
; cdr       - Output of cdr_manager, if loaded.  Read-only.
; dialplan  - Receive NewExten and VarSet events.  Read-only.
; originate - Permission to originate new calls.  Write-only.
