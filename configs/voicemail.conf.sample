;mailcmd=/usr/sbin/sendmail -t
; 
; Users may be located in different timezones, or may have different 
; message announcements for their introductory message when they enter 
; the voicemail system. Set the message and the timezone each user 
; hears here. Set the user into one of these zones with the tz= attribute 
; in the options field of the mailbox. Of course, language substitution 
; still applies here so you may have several directory trees that have 
; alternate language choices. 
; 
; Look in /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for names of timezones. 
; Look at the manual page for strftime for a quick tutorial on how the 
; variable substitution is done on the values below.
