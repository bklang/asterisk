; ENV is a global set of environmental variables that will get set.
; Note that all environmental variables can be seen by all connections,
; so you can't have different values for different connections.
[ENV]
INFORMIXSERVER => my_special_database
INFORMIXDIR => /opt/informix

; All other sections are arbitrary names for database connections.

; Certain servers, such as MS SQL Server and Sybase use the TDS protocol, which
; limits the number of active queries per connection to 1.  By setting up pools
; of connections, Asterisk can be made to work with these servers.
