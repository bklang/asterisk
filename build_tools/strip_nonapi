# This script is designed to remove all non-API global symbols from an object
# file. The only global symbols that should be retained are those that belong
# to the official namespace. Unfortunately doing this is platform-specific, as
# the object file manipulation tools are not consistent across platforms.
#
# On platforms where this script does not know what to do, the object file
# will retain non-API global symbols, and this may have unpleasant side effects.
#
# Prefixes that belong to the official namespace are:
#	ast_
#	_ast_
#	__ast_
#	astman_
#	pbx_
