Asterisk Call Queues
--------------------

<template holder while we wait for input on a good README
 for call queues. Please open a bug report and add text to this
 document>

* Using dynamic queue members

* SIP channel configuration
---------------------------
Queues depend on the channel driver reporting the proper state
for each member of the queue. To get proper signalling on 
queue members that use the SIP channel driver, you need to
enable a call limit (could be set to a high value so it 
is not put into action) and also make sure that both inbound
and outbound calls are accounted for.

Example:

	[general]
	limitonpeer = yes

	[peername]
	type=friend
	call-limit=10
