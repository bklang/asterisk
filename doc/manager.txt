The Asterisk Manager TCP/IP API
===============================

The manager is a client/server model over TCP. With the manager interface,
you'll be able to control the PBX, originate calls, check mailbox status,
monitor channels and queues as well as execute Asterisk commands.

Management users are configured in the configuration file manager.conf and are 
given permissions for read and write, where write represents their ability 
to perform this class of "action", and read represents their ability to 
receive this class of "event".

Command Syntax
--------------

terminated with an empty newline (\r\n) in the style of SMTP, HTTP, and
other headers.
