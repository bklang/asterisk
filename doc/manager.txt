The manager is a client/server model over TCP.

Mangement communication consists of tags of the form "header: value", 
terminated with an empty newline (\r\n) in the style of SMTP, HTTP, and
other headers.

The first tag MUST be one of the following:

Action: An action requested by the CLIENT to the Asterisk SERVER.  Only 
one "Action" may be outstanding at any time.

Response: A response to an action from the Asterisk SERVER to the CLIENT.

Event: An event reported by the Asterisk SERVER to the CLIENT

Management users are configured in /etc/asterisk/manager.conf and are 
given permissions for read and write, where write represents their ability 
to perform this class of "action", and read represents their ability to 
receive this class of "event".
