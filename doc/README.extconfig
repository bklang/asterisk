Asterisk external configuration
===============================

The Asterisk external configuration engine is the result of work by
Anthony Minessale II, Mark Spencer and Constantine (last name???). 
It is designed to provide a flexible, seamless integration between
Asterisk's internal configuration structure and external SQL other other
databases (maybe even LDAP one day).

External configuration is configured in /etc/asterisk/extconfig.conf
allowing you to map any configuration file (static mappings) to
be pulled from the database, or to map special runtime entries which
permit the dynamic creation of objects, entities, peers, etc. without
the necessity of a reload.

Generally speaking, the columns in your tables should line up with the
fields you would specify in the given entity declaration.  If an entry
would appear more than once, in the column it should be separated by a
semicolon. For example, an entity that looks like:

[foo]
host=dynamic
secret=bar
context=default
context=local

could be stored in a table like this:

+------+--------+-------+--------------+----------+-----+-----------+
| name | host   | secret| context      | ipaddr   | port| regseconds|
+------+--------+-------+--------------+----------+-----+-----------+
| foo  | dynamic|  bar  | default;local| 127.0.0.1| 4569| 1096954152|
+------+--------+-------+--------------+----------+-----+-----------+

Note that for use with IAX or SIP, the table will also need the "name", 
"ipaddr", "port", "regseconds" columns.  If you wanted to be able to 
configure the callerid, you could just add a callerid column to the 
table, for example.

A SIP table would look more like this:

+------+--------+-------+----------+-----+------------+----------+
| name | host   | secret| ipaddr   | port| regseconds | username |
+------+--------+-------+----------+-----+------------+----------+
| foo  | dynamic|  bar  | 127.0.0.1| 4569| 1096954152 |   1234   |
+------+--------+-------+----------+-----+------------+----------+

in order to store appropriate parameters required for SIP.
