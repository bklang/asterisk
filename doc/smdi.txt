Asterisk SMDI (Simple Message Desk Interface) integration
---------------------------------------------------------

Support for using Asterisk as an SMDI message desk was developed by Matthew A.
Nicholson <mnicholson@digium.com>.  To enable SMDI support in asterisk edit the
Makefile file and uncomment the line regarding SMDI so it reads like
this:

#
# Asterisk SMDI integration
#
WITH_SMDI = 1

SMDI integration is configured in smdi.conf, zaptel.conf, and voicemail.conf.
Various characteristics of the SMDI interfaces to be used (serial ports) are
defined in smdi.conf.  SMDI integration for callerid and MWI are defined in
zaptel.conf and voicemail.conf respectively.

When SMDI is enabled and a call comes into Asterisk, the forwarding station
number is used as the destination for the call and any callerid information
present is used.  This way you can configure your extensions.conf as follows to
behave as a message desk.

[default]

exten => _XXXXXXX,1,VoiceMail(${EXTEN}|${SMDI_VM_TYPE})
exten => _XXXXXXX,n,Hangup

exten => s,1,VoiceMailMain(${CALLERIDNUM})
exten => s,n,Hangup

The ${SMDI_VM_TYPE} variable will be set to u, b, or nothing depending on the
contents of the type of SMDI message received.
