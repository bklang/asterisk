\section{Introduction}

   Attacks on Voice over IP networks are becoming increasingly more common.  It
has become clear that we must do something within Asterisk to help mitigate
these attacks.

   Through a number of discussions with groups of developers in the Asterisk
community, the general consensus is that the best thing that we can do within
Asterisk is to build a framework which recognizes and reports events that could
potentially have security implications.  Each channel driver has a different
concept of what is an "event", and then each administrator has different
thresholds of what is a "bad" event and what is a restorative event.  The
process of acting upon this information is left to an external program to
correlate and then take action - block traffic, modify dialing rules, etc.  It
was decided that embedding actions inside of Asterisk was inappropriate, as the
complexity of construction of such rule sets is difficult and there was no
agreement on where rules should be enabled or how they should be processed.  The
addition of a major section of code to handle rule expiration and severity
interpretation was significant.  As a final determining factor, there are
external programs and services which already parse log files and act in concert
with packet filters or external devices to protect or alter network security
models for IP connected hosts.

\section{Framework Overview}

    This section discusses the architecture of the Asterisk modifications being
proposed.

    There are two main components that we propose for the initial
implementation of the security framework:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Security Event Generation
    \item Security Event Logger
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Event Generation}

    The ast\_event API is used for the generation of security events.  That
way, the events are in an easily interpretable format within Asterisk to
make it easy to write modules that do things with them.  There are also some
helper data structures and functions to aid Asterisk modules in reporting these
security events with the proper contents.

    The next section of this document contains the current list of security events
being proposed.  Each security event type has some required pieces of
information and some other optional pieces of information.

    Subscribing to security events from within Asterisk can be done by
subscribing to events of type AST\_EVENT\_SECURITY.  These events have an
information element, AST\_EVENT\_IE\_SECURITY\_EVENT, which identifies the security
event sub-type (from the list described in the next section).  The result of the
information elements in the events contain the required and optional meta data
associated with the event sub-type.

\subsection{Security Event Logger}

    In addition to the infrastructure for generating the events, one module that
is a consumer of these events has been implemented.

    Asterisk trunk was recently updated to include support for dynamic logger
levels.  This module takes advantage of this functionality to create a
custom "security" logger level.  Then, when this module is in use, logger.conf
can be configured to put security events into a file:

\begin{verbatim}
    security_log => security
\end{verbatim}

    The content of this file is a well defined and easily interpretable
format for external scripts to read and act upon.  The definition for the format
of the log file is described later in this chapter.

\section{Events to Log}

\begin{verbatim}
(-) required
(+) optional

Invalid Account ID
  (-) Local address family/IP address/port/transport
  (-) Remote address family/IP address/port/transport
  (-) Service (SIP, AMI, IAX2, ...)
  (-) System Name
  (+) Module
  (+) Account ID (username, etc)
  (+) Session ID (CallID, etc)
  (+) Session timestamp (required if Session ID present)
  (-) Event timestamp (sub-second precision)

Failed ACL match
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (+) Name of ACL (when we have named ACLs)

Invalid Challenge/Response
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (-) Challenge
  (-) Response
  (-) Expected Response

Invalid Password
  -> everything from invalid account ID

Successful Authentication
  -> informational event
  -> everything from invalid account ID

Invalid formatting of Request
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  -> account ID optional
  (-) Request Type
  (+) Request parameters

Session Limit Reached (such as a call limit)
  -> everything from invalid account ID

Memory Limit Reached
  -> everything from invalid account ID

Maximum Load Average Reached
  -> everything from invalid account ID

Request Not Allowed
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (-) Request Type
  (+) Request parameters

Request Not Supported
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (-) Request Type

Authentication Method Not Allowed
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (-) Authentication Method attempted

In dialog message from unexpected host
  -> everything from invalid account ID
  (-) expected host
\end{verbatim}

\section{Security Log File Format}

    The beginning of each line in the log file is the same as it is for other
logger levels within Asterisk.

\begin{verbatim}
    [Feb 11 07:57:03] SECURITY[23736] res_security_log.c: <...>
\end{verbatim}

    The part of the log entry identified by $<$...$>$ is where the security event
content resides.  The security event content is a comma separated list
of key value pairs.  The key is the information element type, and the value is a
quoted string that contains the associated meta data for that information
element.  Any embedded quotes within the content are escaped with a
backslash.

\begin{verbatim}
    INFORMATION_ELEMENT_1="IE1 content",INFORMATION_ELEMENT_2="IE2 content"
\end{verbatim}

The following table includes potential information elements and what the
associated content looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
IE: SecurityEvent
Content: This is the security event sub-type.
Values: FailedACL, InvalidAccountID, SessionLimit, MemoryLimit, LoadAverageLimit,
        RequestNotSupported, RequestNotAllowed, AuthMethodNotAllowed,
        ReqBadFormat, UnexpectedAddress, ChallengeResponseFailed,
        InvalidPassword

IE: EventVersion
Content: This is a numeric value that indicates when updates are made to the
         content of the event.

         event.  In most cases, this would be a username.

IE: SessionID
Content: This is a string used to identify the session associated with the
         event.  The format of the session identifier is specific to the
         service.  In the case of SIP, this would be the Call-ID.
