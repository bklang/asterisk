The cdr\_tds module now works with most modern release versions of FreeTDS (from
at least 0.60 through 0.82).  Although versions of FreeTDS prior to 0.82 will
work, we recommend using the latest available version for performance and
stability reasons.

The latest release of FreeTDS is available from http://www.freetds.org/
