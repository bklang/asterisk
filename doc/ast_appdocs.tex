\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
   AddQueueMember(queuename[|interface[|penalty[|options[|membername]]]]):
Dynamically adds interface to an existing queue.
If the interface is already in the queue and there exists an n+101 priority
then it will then jump to this priority.  Otherwise it will return an error
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
       'j' -- jump to +101 priority when appropriate.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     AQMSTATUS    The status of the attempt to add a queue member as a 
                     text string, one of
           ADDED | MEMBERALREADY | NOSUCHQUEUE

\section{AgentLogin}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Call agent login
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  AgentLogin([AgentNo][|options]):
Asks the agent to login to the system.  Always returns -1.  While
logged in, the agent can receive calls and will hear a 'beep'
when a new call comes in. The agent can dump the call by pressing
the star key.
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
      's' -- silent login - do not announce the login ok segment after agent logged in/off

\end{verbatim}


\section{AgentMonitorOutgoing}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Record agent's outgoing call
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  AgentMonitorOutgoing([options]):
Tries to figure out the id of the agent who is placing outgoing call based on
comparison of the callerid of the current interface and the global variable 
placed by the AgentCallbackLogin application. That's why it should be used only
with the AgentCallbackLogin app. Uses the monitoring functions in chan_agent 
instead of Monitor application. That have to be configured in the agents.conf file.

Return value:
Normally the app returns 0 unless the options are passed. Also if the callerid or
the agentid are not specified it'll look for n+101 priority.

Options:
	'd' - make the app return -1 if there is an error condition and there is
	      no extension n+101
	'c' - change the CDR so that the source of the call is 'Agent/agent_id'
	'n' - don't generate the warnings when there is no callerid or the
	      agentid is not known.
             It's handy if you want to have one context for agent and non-agent calls.

\section{AGI}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Executes an AGI compliant application
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  [E|Dead]AGI(command|args): Executes an Asterisk Gateway Interface compliant
program on a channel. AGI allows Asterisk to launch external programs
written in any language to control a telephony channel, play audio,
read DTMF digits, etc. by communicating with the AGI protocol on stdin
and stdout.
  This channel will stop dialplan execution on hangup inside of this
application, except when using DeadAGI.  Otherwise, dialplan execution
will continue normally.
  A locally executed AGI script will receive SIGHUP on hangup from the channel
except when using DeadAGI. This can be disabled by setting the AGISIGHUP channel
variable to "no" before executing the AGI application.
  Using 'EAGI' provides enhanced AGI, with incoming audio available out of band
on file descriptor 3

  Use the CLI command 'agi show' to list available agi commands
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     AGISTATUS      The status of the attempt to the run the AGI script
                    text string, one of SUCCESS | FAILED | HANGUP

\begin{verbatim}
  AMD([initialSilence][|greeting][|afterGreetingSilence][|totalAnalysisTime]
      [|minimumWordLength][|betweenWordsSilence][|maximumNumberOfWords]
      [|silenceThreshold])
  This application attempts to detect answering machines at the beginning
  of outbound calls.  Simply call this application after the call
  has been answered (outbound only, of course).
  When loaded, AMD reads amd.conf and uses the parameters specified as
  default values. Those default values get overwritten when calling AMD
  with parameters.
- 'initialSilence' is the maximum silence duration before the greeting. If
   exceeded then MACHINE.
- 'greeting' is the maximum length of a greeting. If exceeded then MACHINE.
- 'afterGreetingSilence' is the silence after detecting a greeting.
   If exceeded then HUMAN.
- 'totalAnalysisTime' is the maximum time allowed for the algorithm to decide
   on a HUMAN or MACHINE.
- 'minimumWordLength'is the minimum duration of Voice to considered as a word.
- 'betweenWordsSilence' is the minimum duration of silence after a word to 
   consider the audio that follows as a new word.
- 'maximumNumberOfWords'is the maximum number of words in the greeting. 
   If exceeded then MACHINE.
- 'silenceThreshold' is the silence threshold.
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
    AMDSTATUS - This is the status of the answering machine detection.
                Possible values are:
                MACHINE | HUMAN | NOTSURE | HANGUP
    AMDCAUSE - Indicates the cause that led to the conclusion.
               Possible values are:

\section{Authenticate}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Authenticate a user
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Authenticate(password[|options[|maxdigits]]): This application asks the caller
to enter a given password in order to continue dialplan execution. If the password
begins with the '/' character, it is interpreted as a file which contains a list of
valid passwords, listed 1 password per line in the file.
  When using a database key, the value associated with the key can be anything.
Users have three attempts to authenticate before the channel is hung up. If the
passsword is invalid, the 'j' option is specified, and priority n+101 exists,
dialplan execution will continnue at this location.
  Options:
     a - Set the channels' account code to the password that is entered
     d - Interpret the given path as database key, not a literal file
     j - Support jumping to n+101 if authentication fails
     m - Interpret the given path as a file which contains a list of account
         codes and password hashes delimited with ':', listed one per line in
         the file. When one of the passwords is matched, the channel will have
         its account code set to the corresponding account code in the file.
     r - Remove the database key upon successful entry (valid with 'd' only)
     maxdigits  - maximum acceptable number of digits. Stops reading after
         maxdigits have been entered (without requiring the user to
         press the '#' key).
         Defaults to 0 - no limit - wait for the user press the '#' key.

\section{BackGround}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Play an audio file while waiting for digits of an extension to go to.
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Background(filename1[&filename2...][|options[|langoverride][|context]]):
This application will play the given list of files while waiting for an
extension to be dialed by the calling channel. To continue waiting for digits
after this application has finished playing files, the WaitExten application
should be used. The 'langoverride' option explicitly specifies which language
to attempt to use for the requested sound files. If a 'context' is specified,
this is the dialplan context that this application will use when exiting to a
dialed extension.  If one of the requested sound files does not exist, call processing will be
terminated.
  Options:
    s - Causes the playback of the message to be skipped
          if the channel is not in the 'up' state (i.e. it
          hasn't been answered yet). If this happens, the
          application will return immediately.
    n - Don't answer the channel before playing the files.
    m - Only break if a digit hit matches a one digit
          extension in the destination context.
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
 BACKGROUNDSTATUS    The status of the background attempt as a text string, one of
               SUCCESS | FAILED

  BackgroundDetect(filename[|sil[|min|[max]]]):  Plays  back  a  given
filename, waiting for interruption from a given digit (the digit must
start the beginning of a valid extension, or it will be ignored).
During the playback of the file, audio is monitored in the receive
direction, and if a period of non-silence which is greater than 'min' ms
yet less than 'max' ms is followed by silence for at least 'sil' ms then
the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the 'talk' extension
if available.  If unspecified, sil, min, and max default to 1000, 100, and
infinity respectively.

\section{ChanSpy}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Listen to a channel, and optionally whisper into it
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  ChanSpy([chanprefix][|options]): This application is used to listen to the
audio from an Asterisk channel. This includes the audio coming in and
out of the channel being spied on. If the 'chanprefix' parameter is specified,
only channels beginning with this string will be spied upon.
  While spying, the following actions may be performed:
    - Dialing # cycles the volume level.
    - Dialing * will stop spying and look for another channel to spy on.
    - Dialing a series of digits followed by # builds a channel name to append
      to 'chanprefix'. For example, executing ChanSpy(Agent) and then dialing
      the digits '1234#' while spying will begin spying on the channel
      'Agent/1234'.
  Note: The X option supersedes the three features above in that if a valid
        single digit extension exists in the correct context ChanSpy will
        exit to it. This also disables choosing a channel based on 'chanprefix'
        and a digit sequence.
  Options:
    b             - Only spy on channels involved in a bridged call.
    g(grp)        - Match only channels where their ${SPYGROUP} variable is set to
                    contain 'grp' in an optional : delimited list.
    q             - Don't play a beep when beginning to spy on a channel, or speak the
                    selected channel name.
    r[(basename)] - Record the session to the monitor spool directory. An
                    optional base for the filename may be specified. The
                    default is 'chanspy'.
    v([value])    - Adjust the initial volume in the range from -4 to 4. A
                    negative value refers to a quieter setting.
    w             - Enable 'whisper' mode, so the spying channel can talk to
                    the spied-on channel.
    W             - Enable 'private whisper' mode, so the spying channel can
                    talk to the spied-on channel but cannot listen to that
                    channel.
    o             - Only listen to audio coming from this channel.
    X             - Allow the user to exit ChanSpy to a valid single digit
                    numeric extension in the current context or the context
                    specified by the SPY_EXIT_CONTEXT channel variable. The
                    name of the last channel that was spied on will be stored
                    in the SPY_CHANNEL variable.

\section{Dial}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Place a call and connect to the current channel
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Dial(Technology/resource[&Tech2/resource2...][|timeout][|options][|URL]):
This application will place calls to one or more specified channels. As soon
as one of the requested channels answers, the originating channel will be
answered, if it has not already been answered. These two channels will then
be active in a bridged call. All other channels that were requested will then
be hung up.
  Unless there is a timeout specified, the Dial application will wait
indefinitely until one of the called channels answers, the user hangs up, or
if all of the called channels are busy or unavailable. Dialplan executing will
continue if no requested channels can be called, or if the timeout expires.

  This application sets the following channel variables upon completion:
    DIALEDTIME   - This is the time from dialing a channel until when it
                   is disconnected.
    ANSWEREDTIME - This is the amount of time for actual call.
    DIALSTATUS   - This is the status of the call:
                   CHANUNAVAIL | CONGESTION | NOANSWER | BUSY | ANSWER | CANCEL
                   DONTCALL | TORTURE | INVALIDARGS
  For the Privacy and Screening Modes, the DIALSTATUS variable will be set to
DONTCALL if the called party chooses to send the calling party to the 'Go Away'
script. The DIALSTATUS variable will be set to TORTURE if the called party
wants to send the caller to the 'torture' script.
  This application will report normal termination if the originating channel
hangs up, or if the call is bridged and either of the parties in the bridge
ends the call.
  The optional URL will be sent to the called party if the channel supports it.
  If the OUTBOUND_GROUP variable is set, all peer channels created by this
application will be put into that group (as in Set(GROUP()=...).
  If the OUTBOUND_GROUP_ONCE variable is set, all peer channels created by this
application will be put into that group (as in Set(GROUP()=...). Unlike OUTBOUND_GROUP,
however, the variable will be unset after use.

  Options:
    A(x) - Play an announcement to the called party, using 'x' as the file.
    C    - Reset the CDR for this call.
    d    - Allow the calling user to dial a 1 digit extension while waiting for
           a call to be answered. Exit to that extension if it exists in the
           current context, or the context defined in the EXITCONTEXT variable,
           if it exists.
    D([called][:calling]) - Send the specified DTMF strings *after* the called
           party has answered, but before the call gets bridged. The 'called'
           DTMF string is sent to the called party, and the 'calling' DTMF
           string is sent to the calling party. Both parameters can be used
           alone.
    f    - Force the callerid of the *calling* channel to be set as the
           extension associated with the channel using a dialplan 'hint'.
           For example, some PSTNs do not allow CallerID to be set to anything
           other than the number assigned to the caller.
    g    - Proceed with dialplan execution at the current extension if the
           destination channel hangs up.
    G(context^exten^pri) - If the call is answered, transfer the calling party to
           the specified priority and the called party to the specified priority+1.
           Optionally, an extension, or extension and context may be specified. 
           Otherwise, the current extension is used. You cannot use any additional
           action post answer options in conjunction with this option.
    h    - Allow the called party to hang up by sending the '*' DTMF digit.
    H    - Allow the calling party to hang up by hitting the '*' DTMF digit.
    i    - Asterisk will ignore any forwarding requests it may receive on this
           dial attempt.
    j    - Jump to priority n+101 if all of the requested channels were busy.
    L(x[:y][:z]) - Limit the call to 'x' ms. Play a warning when 'y' ms are
           left. Repeat the warning every 'z' ms. The following special
           variables can be used with this option:
           * LIMIT_PLAYAUDIO_CALLER   yes|no (default yes)
                                      Play sounds to the caller.
           * LIMIT_PLAYAUDIO_CALLEE   yes|no
                                      Play sounds to the callee.
           * LIMIT_TIMEOUT_FILE       File to play when time is up.
           * LIMIT_CONNECT_FILE       File to play when call begins.
           * LIMIT_WARNING_FILE       File to play as warning if 'y' is defined.
                                      The default is to say the time remaining.
    m([class]) - Provide hold music to the calling party until a requested
           channel answers. A specific MusicOnHold class can be
           specified.
    M(x[^arg]) - Execute the Macro for the *called* channel before connecting
           to the calling channel. Arguments can be specified to the Macro
           using '^' as a delimeter. The Macro can set the variable
           MACRO_RESULT to specify the following actions after the Macro is
           finished executing.
           * ABORT        Hangup both legs of the call.
           * CONGESTION   Behave as if line congestion was encountered.
           * BUSY         Behave as if a busy signal was encountered. This will also
                          have the application jump to priority n+101 if the
                          'j' option is set.
           * CONTINUE     Hangup the called party and allow the calling party
                          to continue dialplan execution at the next priority.
           * GOTO:<context>^<exten>^<priority> - Transfer the call to the
                          specified priority. Optionally, an extension, or
                          extension and priority can be specified.
           You cannot use any additional action post answer options in conjunction
           with this option. Also, pbx services are not run on the peer (called) channel,
           so you will not be able to set timeouts via the TIMEOUT() function in this macro.
    n    - This option is a modifier for the screen/privacy mode. It specifies
           that no introductions are to be saved in the priv-callerintros
           directory.
    N    - This option is a modifier for the screen/privacy mode. It specifies
           that if callerID is present, do not screen the call.
    o    - Specify that the CallerID that was present on the *calling* channel
           be set as the CallerID on the *called* channel. This was the
           behavior of Asterisk 1.0 and earlier.
    O([x]) - "Operator Services" mode (Zaptel channel to Zaptel channel
             only, if specified on non-Zaptel interface, it will be ignored).
             When the destination answers (presumably an operator services
             station), the originator no longer has control of their line.
             They may hang up, but the switch will not release their line
             until the destination party hangs up (the operator). Specified
             without an arg, or with 1 as an arg, the originator hanging up
             will cause the phone to ring back immediately. With a 2 specified,
             when the "operator" flashes the trunk, it will ring their phone
             back.
    p    - This option enables screening mode. This is basically Privacy mode
           without memory.
    P([x]) - Enable privacy mode. Use 'x' as the family/key in the database if
           it is provided. The current extension is used if a database
           family/key is not specified.
    r    - Indicate ringing to the calling party. Pass no audio to the calling
           party until the called channel has answered.
    S(x) - Hang up the call after 'x' seconds *after* the called party has
           answered the call.
    t    - Allow the called party to transfer the calling party by sending the
           DTMF sequence defined in features.conf.
    T    - Allow the calling party to transfer the called party by sending the
           DTMF sequence defined in features.conf.
    w    - Allow the called party to enable recording of the call by sending
           the DTMF sequence defined for one-touch recording in features.conf.
    W    - Allow the calling party to enable recording of the call by sending
           the DTMF sequence defined for one-touch recording in features.conf.
    k    - Allow the called party to enable parking of the call by sending
           the DTMF sequence defined for call parking in features.conf.
    K    - Allow the calling party to enable parking of the call by sending
           the DTMF sequence defined for call parking in features.conf.

\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Provide directory of voicemail extensions
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Directory(vm-context[|dial-context[|options]]): This application will present
the calling channel with a directory of extensions from which they can search
by name. The list of names and corresponding extensions is retrieved from the
voicemail configuration file, voicemail.conf.
  This application will immediately exit if one of the following DTMF digits are
received and the extension to jump to exists:
    0 - Jump to the 'o' extension, if it exists.
    * - Jump to the 'a' extension, if it exists.

  Parameters:
    vm-context   - This is the context within voicemail.conf to use for the
                   Directory.
    dial-context - This is the dialplan context to use when looking for an
                   extension that the user has selected, or when jumping to the
                   'o' or 'a' extension.

  Options:
    e - In addition to the name, also read the extension number to the
        caller before presenting dialing options.
    f - Allow the caller to enter the first name of a user in the directory
        instead of using the last name.

\section{DISA}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
DISA (Direct Inward System Access)
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
DISA(<numeric passcode>[|<context>]) or DISA(<filename>)
The DISA, Direct Inward System Access, application allows someone from 
outside the telephone switch (PBX) to obtain an "internal" system 
dialtone and to place calls from it as if they were placing a call from 
within the switch.
DISA plays a dialtone. The user enters their numeric passcode, followed by
the pound sign (#). If the passcode is correct, the user is then given
system dialtone on which a call may be placed. Obviously, this type
of access has SERIOUS security implications, and GREAT care must be
taken NOT to compromise your security.

There is a possibility of accessing DISA without password. Simply
exchange your password with "no-password".

    Example: exten => s,1,DISA(no-password|local)

Be aware that using this compromises the security of your PBX.

The arguments to this application (in extensions.conf) allow either
specification of a single global passcode (that everyone uses), or
individual passcodes contained in a file. It also allows specification
of the context on which the user will be dialing. If no context is
specified, the DISA application defaults the context to "disa".
Presumably a normal system will have a special context set up
for DISA use with some or a lot of restrictions. 

The file that contains the passcodes (if used) allows specification
of either just a passcode (defaulting to the "disa" context, or
passcode|context on each line of the file. The file may contain blank
lines, or comments starting with "#" or ";". In addition, the
above arguments may have |new-callerid-string appended to them, to
specify a new (different) callerid to be used for this call, for
example: numeric-passcode|context|"My Phone" <(234) 123-4567> or 
full-pathname-of-passcode-file|"My Phone" <(234) 123-4567>.  Last
but not least, |mailbox[@context] may be appended, which will cause
a stutter-dialtone (indication "dialrecall") to be used, if the
specified mailbox contains any new messages, for example:
numeric-passcode|context||1234 (w/a changing callerid).  Note that
in the case of specifying the numeric-passcode, the context must be
specified if the callerid is specified also.

If login is successful, the application looks up the dialed number in
the specified (or default) context, and executes it if found.
If the user enters an invalid extension and extension "i" (invalid) 
exists in the context, it will be used. Also, if you set the 5th argument
to 'NOANSWER', the DISA application will not answer initially.

\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  [E|Dead]AGI(command|args): Executes an Asterisk Gateway Interface compliant
program on a channel. AGI allows Asterisk to launch external programs
written in any language to control a telephony channel, play audio,
read DTMF digits, etc. by communicating with the AGI protocol on stdin
and stdout.
  This channel will stop dialplan execution on hangup inside of this
application, except when using DeadAGI.  Otherwise, dialplan execution
will continue normally.
  A locally executed AGI script will receive SIGHUP on hangup from the channel
except when using DeadAGI. This can be disabled by setting the AGISIGHUP channel
variable to "no" before executing the AGI application.
  Using 'EAGI' provides enhanced AGI, with incoming audio available out of band
on file descriptor 3

  Use the CLI command 'agi show' to list available agi commands
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
     AGISTATUS      The status of the attempt to the run the AGI script
                    text string, one of SUCCESS | FAILED | HANGUP

\section{ExtenSpy}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Listen to a channel, and optionally whisper into it
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  ExtenSpy(exten[@context][|options]): This application is used to listen to the
audio from an Asterisk channel. This includes the audio coming in and
out of the channel being spied on. Only channels created by outgoing calls for the
specified extension will be selected for spying. If the optional context is not
supplied, the current channel's context will be used.
  While spying, the following actions may be performed:
    - Dialing # cycles the volume level.
    - Dialing * will stop spying and look for another channel to spy on.
  Note: The X option superseeds the two features above in that if a valid
        single digit extension exists in the correct context it ChanSpy will
        exit to it.
  Options:
    b             - Only spy on channels involved in a bridged call.
    g(grp)        - Match only channels where their ${SPYGROUP} variable is set to
                    contain 'grp' in an optional : delimited list.
    q             - Don't play a beep when beginning to spy on a channel, or speak the
                    selected channel name.
    r[(basename)] - Record the session to the monitor spool directory. An
                    optional base for the filename may be specified. The
                    default is 'chanspy'.
    v([value])    - Adjust the initial volume in the range from -4 to 4. A
                    negative value refers to a quieter setting.
    w             - Enable 'whisper' mode, so the spying channel can talk to
                    the spied-on channel.
    W             - Enable 'private whisper' mode, so the spying channel can
                    talk to the spied-on channel but cannot listen to that
                    channel.
    o             - Only listen to audio coming from this channel.
    X             - Allow the user to exit ChanSpy to a valid single digit
                    numeric extension in the current context or the context
                    specified by the SPY_EXIT_CONTEXT channel variable. The
                    name of the last channel that was spied on will be stored

\section{Goto}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Jump to a particular priority, extension, or context
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Goto([[context|]extension|]priority): This application will set the current
context, extension, and priority in the channel structure. After it completes, the
pbx engine will continue dialplan execution at the specified location.
If no specific extension, or extension and context, are specified, then this
application will just set the specified priority of the current extension.
  At least a priority is required as an argument, or the goto will return a -1,
and the channel and call will be terminated.
  If the location that is put into the channel information is bogus, and asterisk cannot
find that location in the dialplan,
then the execution engine will try to find and execute the code in the 'i' (invalid)
extension in the current context. If that does not exist, it will try to execute the
'h' extension. If either or neither the 'h' or 'i' extensions have been defined, the
channel is hung up, and the execution of instructions on the channel is terminated.
What this means is that, for example, you specify a context that does not exist, then
it will not be possible to find the 'h' or 'i' extensions, and the call will terminate!

\end{verbatim}


\section{GotoIf}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Conditional goto
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  GotoIf(condition?[labeliftrue]:[labeliffalse]): This application will set the current
context, extension, and priority in the channel structure based on the evaluation of
the given condition. After this application completes, the
pbx engine will continue dialplan execution at the specified location in the dialplan.
The channel will continue at
'labeliftrue' if the condition is true, or 'labeliffalse' if the condition is
false. The labels are specified with the same syntax as used within the Goto
application.  If the label chosen by the condition is omitted, no jump is
performed, and the execution passes to the next instruction.
If the target location is bogus, and does not exist, the execution engine will try 
to find and execute the code in the 'i' (invalid)
extension in the current context. If that does not exist, it will try to execute the
'h' extension. If either or neither the 'h' or 'i' extensions have been defined, the
channel is hung up, and the execution of instructions on the channel is terminated.
Remember that this command can set the current context, and if the context specified
does not exist, then it will not be able to find any 'h' or 'i' extensions there, and
the channel and call will both be terminated!

\begin{verbatim}
Conditional Goto based on the current time
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}

This application will set the context, extension, and priority in the channel structure
if the current time matches the given time specification. Otherwise, nothing is done.
Further information on the time specification can be found in examples
illustrating how to do time-based context includes in the dialplan.
If the target jump location is bogus, the same actions would be taken as for Goto.

\section{Macro}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Macro Implementation
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Macro(macroname|arg1|arg2...): Executes a macro using the context
'macro-<macroname>', jumping to the 's' extension of that context and
executing each step, then returning when the steps end. 
The calling extension, context, and priority are stored in ${MACRO_EXTEN}, 
${MACRO_CONTEXT} and ${MACRO_PRIORITY} respectively.  Arguments become
${ARG1}, ${ARG2}, etc in the macro context.
If you Goto out of the Macro context, the Macro will terminate and control
will be returned at the location of the Goto.
If ${MACRO_OFFSET} is set at termination, Macro will attempt to continue
at priority MACRO_OFFSET + N + 1 if such a step exists, and N + 1 otherwise.
Extensions: While a macro is being executed, it becomes the current context.
            This means that if a hangup occurs, for instance, that the macro
            will be searched for an 'h' extension, NOT the context from which
            the macro was called. So, make sure to define all appropriate
            extensions in your macro! (Note: AEL does not use macros)
WARNING: Because of the way Macro is implemented (it executes the priorities
         contained within it via sub-engine), and a fixed per-thread
         memory stack allowance, macros are limited to 7 levels
         of nesting (macro calling macro calling macro, etc.); It
         may be possible that stack-intensive applications in deeply nested macros
         could cause asterisk to crash earlier than this limit. It is advised that
         if you need to deeply nest macro calls, that you use the Gosub application
         (now allows arguments like a Macro) with explict Return() calls instead.

The given interface will be paused in the given queue.  This prevents
any calls from being sent from the queue to the interface until it is
unpaused with UnpauseQueueMember or the manager interface.  If no
queuename is given, the interface is paused in every queue it is a
member of.  If the interface is not in the named queue, or if no queue
is given and the interface is not in any queue, it will jump to
priority n+101, if it exists and the appropriate options are set.
The application will fail if the interface is not found and no extension
to jump to exists.
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
       'j' -- jump to +101 priority when appropriate.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:

\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  Playback(filename[&filename2...][|option]):  Plays back given filenames (do not put
extension). Options may also be included following a pipe symbol. The 'skip'
option causes the playback of the message to be skipped if the channel
is not in the 'up' state (i.e. it hasn't been  answered  yet). If 'skip' is 
specified, the application will return immediately should the channel not be
off hook.  Otherwise, unless 'noanswer' is specified, the channel will
be answered before the sound is played. Not all channels support playing
messages while still on hook. If 'j' is specified, the application
will jump to priority n+101 if present when a file specified to be played
does not exist.
This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
 PLAYBACKSTATUS    The status of the playback attempt as a text string, one of

\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  PrivacyManager([maxretries[|minlength[|options]]]): If no Caller*ID 
is sent, PrivacyManager answers the channel and asks the caller to
enter their phone number. The caller is given 3 attempts to do so.
The application does nothing if Caller*ID was received on the channel.
  Configuration file privacy.conf contains two variables:
   maxretries  default 3  -maximum number of attempts the caller is allowed 
               to input a callerid.
   minlength   default 10 -minimum allowable digits in the input callerid number.
If you don't want to use the config file and have an i/o operation with
every call, you can also specify maxretries and minlength as application
parameters. Doing so supercedes any values set in privacy.conf.
The option string may contain the following character: 
  'j' -- jump to n+101 priority after <maxretries> failed attempts to collect
         the minlength number of digits.
The application sets the following channel variable upon completion: 
PRIVACYMGRSTATUS  The status of the privacy manager's attempt to collect

Queues an incoming call in a particular call queue as defined in queues.conf.
This application will return to the dialplan if the queue does not exist, or
any of the join options cause the caller to not enter the queue.
The option string may contain zero or more of the following characters:
      'd' -- data-quality (modem) call (minimum delay).
      'h' -- allow callee to hang up by pressing *.
      'H' -- allow caller to hang up by pressing *.
      'n' -- no retries on the timeout; will exit this application and 
             go to the next step.
      'i' -- ignore call forward requests from queue members and do nothing
             when they are requested.
      'r' -- ring instead of playing MOH.
      't' -- allow the called user to transfer the calling user.
      'T' -- allow the calling user to transfer the call.
      'w' -- allow the called user to write the conversation to disk via Monitor.
      'W' -- allow the calling user to write the conversation to disk via Monitor.
  In addition to transferring the call, a call may be parked and then picked
up by another user.
  The optional URL will be sent to the called party if the channel supports
it.
  The optional AGI parameter will setup an AGI script to be executed on the 
calling party's channel once they are connected to a queue member.
  The optional macro parameter will run a macro on the 
calling party's channel once they are connected to a queue member.
  The timeout will cause the queue to fail out after a specified number of
seconds, checked between each queues.conf 'timeout' and 'retry' cycle.
  This application sets the following channel variable upon completion:
      QUEUESTATUS    The status of the call as a text string, one of

     't' : use alternate '*' terminator key (DTMF) instead of default '#'
     'x' : ignore all terminator keys (DTMF) and keep recording until hangup

If filename contains '%d', these characters will be replaced with a number
incremented by one each time the file is recorded. A channel variable
named RECORDED_FILE will also be set, which contains the final filemname.

Use 'core show file formats' to see the available formats on your system

\section{WaitForSilence}
\subsection{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
Waits for a specified amount of silence
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Description}
\begin{verbatim}
  WaitForSilence(silencerequired[|iterations][|timeout]) 
Wait for Silence: Waits for up to 'silencerequired' 
milliseconds of silence, 'iterations' times or once if omitted.
An optional timeout specified the number of seconds to return
after, even if we do not receive the specified amount of silence.
Use 'timeout' with caution, as it may defeat the purpose of this
application, which is to wait indefinitely until silence is detected
on the line.  This is particularly useful for reverse-911-type
call broadcast applications where you need to wait for an answering
machine to complete its spiel before playing a message.
The timeout parameter is specified only to avoid an infinite loop in
cases where silence is never achieved.  Typically you will want to
include two or more calls to WaitForSilence when dealing with an answering
machine; first waiting for the spiel to finish, then waiting for the beep, etc.

Examples:
  - WaitForSilence(500|2) will wait for 1/2 second of silence, twice
  - WaitForSilence(1000) will wait for 1 second of silence, once
  - WaitForSilence(300|3|10) will wait for 300ms silence, 3 times,
     and returns after 10 sec, even if silence is not detected

Sets the channel variable WAITSTATUS with to one of these values:
SILENCE - if exited with silence detected
TIMEOUT - if exited without silence detected after timeout
