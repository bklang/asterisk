/**
 * Gets an ASCII representation of all envelope headers

 * @param ctx A valid MiniMIME context

 * @param length Where to store the length of the result
 * @returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
 * @note Sets mm_errno on failure
 *
 * This is mainly a convinience function. It constructs an ASCII representation
 * from all of the message's envelope headers and stores the result in headers.
 * Memory is allocated dynamically, and the total length of the result is
 * stored in length. This function takes care that the output is MIME conform,
 * and folds long lines according to the MIME standard at position 78 of the
 * string. It also nicely formats all MIME related header fields, such as
 * the Content-Type header.
 *
 * Since the memory needed to store the result is allocated dynamically, one
 * should take care of freeing it again when it's not needed anymore. If an
 * error occurs, *result will be set to NULL, *length will be set to zero
 * and mm_errno will be set to a reasonable value.
