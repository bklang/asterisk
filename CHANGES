       http://bugs.digium.com.  Documentation and formatting fixes are not
       not listed here.  A complete listing of changes is available through
       the Asterisk-CVS mailing list hosted at http://lists.digium.com.

Asterisk 1.2.0

 -- Some of the major feature upgrades ...

 -- DUNDi (Distributed Universal Number Discovery -- http://www.dundi.com)
 -- AEL (Asterisk Extension Logic)
 -- Realtime Database Configuration Engine
 -- Native Music on Hold
 -- Native IAX Encryption
 -- New Jitter Buffer
 -- Q.SIG Switchtype for PRI
 -- FastAGI (AGI over TCP)
 -- Dialplan Functions
 -- ODBC Storage of Voicemail

Asterisk 1.0.10

 -- chan_local
    -- In releases 1.0.8 and 1.0.9, the Local channels that are created would
       not be masqueraded into the new channel type.  This has now been fixed.
 -- chan_sip
    -- The 'insecure' options have been changed to support matching peersby IP
       only, not requiring authentication on incoming invites, or both. Before,
       to not require authentication on incoming invites also required matching
       peers based on IP only.
 -- chan_zap
    -- Before, call waiting could occur during the initial ringing on the line.
       This has now been fixed.
 -- app_disa
    -- We will now not set the accountcode if one is not supplied. 
 -- app_meetme
    -- If the first caller into a conference hangs up while being prompted for
       the conference pin number, the conference will no longer be held open.
 -- app_userevent
    -- Events created with this application were indicated as a "call" event
       instead of a "user" event.  This made the "user" event permissions
       not work correctly.
 -- app_voicemail
    -- When using the externpass option for voicemail, the password will be
       immediately updated in memory as well, instead of having to wait for
       the next time the configuration is reloaded. 
 -- app_zapras
    -- We now ensure buffer policy is restored after RAS is done with a channel.
       This could cause audio problems on the channel after zapras is done
       with it. 
 -- res_agi
    -- We now unmask the SIGHUP signal before executing an AGI script.  This
       fixes problems where some AGI scripts would continue running long after
       the call is over.
 -- extensions
    -- A potential crash has been fixed when calling LEN() to get the length of
       a string that was 80 characters or larger.
 -- logger
    -- The Asterisk logger will automatically detect when a log file needs to
       be rotated.  However, this feature could put Asterisk in a nasty loop
       that would result in a crash.
 -- general
    -- Added man pages for astgenkey, autosupport, and safe_asterisk

Asterisk 1.0.9

 -- fix bug in callerid matching in the dialplan that was introduced in 1.0.8

Asterisk 1.0.8

 -- chan_zap
    -- Asterisk will now also look in the regular context for the fax extension
       while executing a macro.  Previously, for this to work, the fax extension
       would have to be included in the macro definition.
    -- On some systems, ALERTING will be sent after PROCEEDING, so code has been
       added to account for this case.
    -- If no extension is specified on an overlap call, the 's' extension will 
       be used.
 -- chan_sip
    -- We no longer send a "to" tag on "100 Trying" messages, as it is 
       inappropriate to do so.
    -- We now respond correctly to an invite for T.38 with a "488 Not acceptable
       here"
    -- We now discard saved tags on 401/407 responses in case the provider we're
       talking to tries to pull a dirty trick on us and change it.
    -- rtptimeout options will now be correctly set on a peer basis rather than
       only global
 -- chan_mgcp
    -- Fixed setting of accountcode
    -- Fixed where *67 to block callerid only worked for first call
 -- chan_agent
    -- We now will not pass audio until the agent has acked the call if the 
       configuration
       is set up for the agent to do so.
 -- chan_alsa
    -- Fixed problems with the unloading of this module
 -- res_agi
    -- A fix has been added to prevent calls from being hung up when more than 
       one call is executing an AGI script calling the GET DATA command.
    -- AGI scripts will now continue to run even if a file was not found with
       the GET DATA command.
    -- When calling SAY NUMBER with a number like 09, we will now say "nine" 
       instead of "zero"
 -- app_dial
    -- There was a problem where text frames would not be forwarded before the
       channel has been answered. 
 -- app_disa
    -- Fixed the timeout used when no password is set
 -- app_queue
    -- Distinctive ring has been fixed to work for queue members
  -- rtp
    -- Fixed a logic error when setting the "rtpchecksums" option
 -- say.c
    -- A problem has been fixed with saying the date in Spanish.
 -- Makefile
    -- A line was missing for the autosupport script that caused "make rpm" to 
       fail
 -- format_wav_gsm
    -- Fixed a problem with wav formatting that prevented files from being 
       played in some media players
 -- pbx_spool
    -- Fixed if the last line of text in a file for the call spool did not 
       contain a new line, it would not be processed
 -- logger
    -- Fixed the logger so that color escape sequences wouldn't be sent to the 
       logs
 -- format_sln
    -- A lot of changes were made to correctly handle signed linear format on
       big endian machines
 -- asterisk.conf
     -- fix 'highpriority' option for asterisk.conf

Asterisk 1.0.7

 -- chan_sip
    -- The fix for some codec availibility issues in 1.0.6 caused music on hold
       problems, but has now been fixed.
 -- chan_skinny
    -- A check has been added to avoid a crash.
 -- chan_iax2
    -- A feature has been added to CVS head to have the option of sending 
       timestamps with trunk frames.  It is not supported in 1.0, but a change 
       has been made so that it will at least not choke if sent trunk
       timestamps.
 -- app_voicemail
    -- Some checks have been added to avoid a crash.
 -- speex
    -- The path /usr/include/speex has been added for a place to look for the 
       speex header.

Asterisk 1.0.6

 -- chan_iax2:
    -- Fixed a bug dealing with a division by zero that could cause a crash
 -- chan_sip:
    -- Behavior was changed so that when a registration fails due to DNS 
       resolution issues, a retry will be attempted in 20 seconds.
    -- Peer settings were not reset to null values when reloading the 
       configuration file. Behavior has been changed so that these values are 
       now cleared.
    -- 'restrictcid' now properly works on MySQL peers.
    -- Only use the default callerid if it has been specified.
    -- Asterisk was not sending the same From: line in SIP messages during 
       certain times. Fixed to make sure it stays the same. This makes some 
       providers happier, to a working state.
    -- Certain circumstances involving a blank callerid caused asterisk to 
       segmentation fault.
    -- There was a problem incorrectly matching codec availablity when global 
       preferences were different from that of the user.  To fix this, 
       processing of SDP data has been moved to after determining who the call 
       is coming from.
    -- Asterisk would run out of RTP ports while waiting for SUBSCRIBE's to 
       expire even though an RTP port isn't needed in this case.  This has been
       fixed by releasing the ports early.
 -- chan_zap:
    -- During a certain scenario when using flash and '#' transfers you would 
       hear the other person and the music they were hearing. This has been 
       fixed.
    -- A fix for a compilation issue with gcc4 was added.
 -- chan_modem_bestdata:
    -- A fix for a compilation issue with gcc4 was added.
 -- format_g729:
    -- Treat a 10-byte read as an end of file indication instead of an error. 
       Some G729 encoders like to put 10-bytes at the end to indicate this.
 -- res_features:
    -- During certain situations when parking a call, both endpoints would get 
       musiconhold. This has been fixed so the individual who parked the call 
       will hear the digits and not musiconhold.
 -- app_dial:
    -- DIALEDPEERNUMBER is now being set, so if you attempted to use it in the 
       past and failed, it should work now.
    -- A callerid change caused many headaches, this has been reversed to the 
       original 1.0 behavior.
    -- A crash caused with the combination of the 'g' option and # transfer was
       fixed.
 -- app_voicemail:
    -- If two people hit the voicemail system at the same time, and were leaving
       a message the second message was overwriting the first. This has been 
       fixed so that each one is distinct and will not overwrite eachother.
 -- cdr_tds:
    -- If the server you were using was going down, it had the potential to 
       bring your asterisk server down with it. Extra stuff has been added so 
       as to bring in more error/connection checking.
 -- cdr_pgsql:
    -- This will now attempt to reconnect after a connection problem.
 -- IAXY firmware:
    -- This has been updated to version 23.  It includes a fix for lost
       registrations.
 -- internals
    -- Behavior was changed for 'show codec <number>' to make it more intuitive.
    -- DNS failures and asterisk do not get along too well, this is not totally
       the case anymore.
    -- Asterisk will now handle DNS failures at startup more gracefully, and 
       won't crash and burn
    -- Choosing to append to a wave file would render the outputted wave file 
       corrupt. Appending now works again.
    -- If you failed to define certain keys, asterisk had the potential to crash
       when seeing if you had used them.
    -- Attempting to use such things as ${EXTEN:-1} gave a wrong return value. 
       However, this was never a documented feature...
