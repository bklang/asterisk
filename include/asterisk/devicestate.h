 * \brief Device state management
 *
 * To subscribe to device state changes, use the generic ast_event_subscribe
 * method.  For an example, see apps/app_queue.c.
 *
 * \todo Currently, when the state of a device changes, the device state provider
 * calls one of the functions defined here to queue an object to say that the 
 * state of a device has changed.  However, this does not include the new state.
 * Another thread processes these device state change objects and calls the
 * device state provider's callback to figure out what the new state is.  It
 * would make a lot more sense for the new state to be included in the original
 * function call that says the state of a device has changed.  However, it
 * will take a lot of work to change this.
 *
 * \arg See \ref AstExtState
