 * \brief Support for Private Asterisk HTTP Servers.
 * \note Note: The Asterisk HTTP servers are extremely simple and minimal and
 *      only support the "GET" method.
 *
 * \author Mark Spencer <markster@digium.com>
 *
 * \note In order to have TLS/SSL support, we need the openssl libraries.
 * Still we can decide whether or not to use them by commenting
 * in or out the DO_SSL macro.
 * TLS/SSL support is basically implemented by reading from a config file
 * (currently http.conf) the names of the certificate and cipher to use,
 * and then run ssl_setup() to create an appropriate SSL_CTX (ssl_ctx)
 * If we support multiple domains, presumably we need to read multiple
 * certificates.
 * When we are requested to open a TLS socket, we run make_file_from_fd()
 * on the socket, to do the necessary setup. At the moment the context's name
 * is hardwired in the function, but we can certainly make it into an extra
 * parameter to the function.
 * We declare most of ssl support variables unconditionally,
 * because their number is small and this simplifies the code.
 *
 * \note: the ssl-support variables (ssl_ctx, do_ssl, certfile, cipher)
 * and their setup should be moved to a more central place, e.g. asterisk.conf
 * and the source files that processes it. Similarly, ssl_setup() should
 * be run earlier in the startup process so modules have it available.
