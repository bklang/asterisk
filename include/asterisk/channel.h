/*! \page Def_Channel Asterisk Channels
	\par What is a Channel?
	A phone call through Asterisk consists of an incoming
	connection and an outbound connection. Each call comes
	in through a channel driver that supports one technology,
	like SIP, ZAP, IAX2 etc. 
	\par
	Each channel driver, technology, has it's own private
	channel or dialog structure, that is technology-dependent.
	Each private structure is "owned" by a generic Asterisk
	channel structure, defined in channel.h and handled by
	channel.c .
	\par Call scenario
	This happens when an incoming call arrives to Asterisk
	-# Call arrives on a channel driver interface
	-# Channel driver creates a PBX channel and starts a 
	   pbx thread on the channel
	-# The dial plan is executed
	-# At this point at least two things can happen:
		-# The call is answered by Asterisk and 
		   Asterisk plays a media stream or reads media
		-# The dial plan forces Asterisk to create an outbound 
		   call somewhere with the dial (see \ref app_dial.c)
		   application
	.

	\par Bridging channels
	If Asterisk dials out this happens:
	-# Dial creates an outbound PBX channel and asks one of the
	   channel drivers to create a call
	-# When the call is answered, Asterisk bridges the media streams
	   so the caller on the first channel can speak with the callee
	   on the second, outbound channel
	-# In some cases where we have the same technology on both
	   channels and compatible codecs, a native bridge is used.
	   In a native bridge, the channel driver handles forwarding
	   of incoming audio to the outbound stream internally, without
	   sending audio frames through the PBX.
	-# In SIP, theres an "external native bridge" where Asterisk
	   redirects the endpoint, so audio flows directly between the
	   caller's phone and the callee's phone. Signalling stays in
	   Asterisk in order to be able to provide a proper CDR record
	   for the call.

	
	\par Masquerading channels
	In some cases, a channel can masquerade itself into another
	channel. This happens frequently in call transfers, where 
	a new channel takes over a channel that is already involved
	in a call. The new channel sneaks in and takes over the bridge
	and the old channel, now a zombie, is hung up.
