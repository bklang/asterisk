 * \page AstObj2 Object Model implementing objects and containers.

This module implements an abstraction for objects (with locks and
reference counts), and containers for these user-defined objects,
also supporting locking, reference counting and callbacks.

The internal implementation of objects and containers is opaque to the user,
so we can use different data structures as needs arise.

\section AstObj2_UsageObjects USAGE - OBJECTS

An ao2 object is a block of memory that the user code can access,
and for which the system keeps track (with a bit of help from the
programmer) of the number of references around.  When an object has
no more references (refcount == 0), it is destroyed, by first
invoking whatever 'destructor' function the programmer specifies
(it can be NULL if none is necessary), and then freeing the memory.
This way objects can be shared without worrying who is in charge
of freeing them.
As an additional feature, ao2 objects are associated to individual
locks.

Creating an object requires the size of the object and
and a pointer to the destructor function:
 
    struct foo *o;
 
    o = ao2_alloc(sizeof(struct foo), my_destructor_fn);

The value returned points to the user-visible portion of the objects
(user-data), but is also used as an identifier for all object-related
operations such as refcount and lock manipulations.

On return from ao2_alloc():

 - the object has a refcount = 1;
 - the memory for the object is allocated dynamically and zeroed;
 - we cannot realloc() the object itself;
 - we cannot call free(o) to dispose of the object. Rather, we
   tell the system that we do not need the reference anymore:

    ao2_ref(o, -1)

  causing the destructor to be called (and then memory freed) when
  the refcount goes to 0. 

- ao2_ref(o, +1) can be used to modify the refcount on the
  object in case we want to pass it around.

- ao2_lock(obj), ao2_unlock(obj), ao2_trylock(obj) can be used
  to manipulate the lock associated with the object.


\section AstObj2_UsageContainers USAGE - CONTAINERS

An ao2 container is an abstract data structure where we can store
ao2 objects, search them (hopefully in an efficient way), and iterate
or apply a callback function to them. A container is just an ao2 object
itself.

A container must first be allocated, specifying the initial
parameters. At the moment, this is done as follows:

    <b>Sample Usage:</b>
    \code

    struct ao2_container *c;

    c = ao2_container_alloc(MAX_BUCKETS, my_hash_fn, my_cmp_fn);
    \endcode

where

- MAX_BUCKETS is the number of buckets in the hash table,
- my_hash_fn() is the (user-supplied) function that returns a
  hash key for the object (further reduced modulo MAX_BUCKETS
  by the container's code);
- my_cmp_fn() is the default comparison function used when doing
  searches on the container,

A container knows little or nothing about the objects it stores,
other than the fact that they have been created by ao2_alloc().
All knowledge of the (user-defined) internals of the objects
is left to the (user-supplied) functions passed as arguments
to ao2_container_alloc().

If we want to insert an object in a container, we should
initialize its fields -- especially, those used by my_hash_fn() --
to compute the bucket to use.
Once done, we can link an object to a container with

    ao2_link(c, o);

The function returns NULL in case of errors (and the object
is not inserted in the container). Other values mean success
(we are not supposed to use the value as a pointer to anything).
Linking an object to a container increases its refcount by 1
automatically.

\note While an object o is in a container, we expect that
my_hash_fn(o) will always return the same value. The function
does not lock the object to be computed, so modifications of
those fields that affect the computation of the hash should
be done by extracting the object from the container, and
reinserting it after the change (this is not terribly expensive).

\note A container with a single buckets is effectively a linked
list. However there is no ordering among elements.

/*
\note DEBUGGING REF COUNTS BIBLE:
An interface to help debug refcounting is provided 
in this package. It is dependent on the REF_DEBUG macro being
defined in a source file, before the #include of astobj2.h, 
and in using variants of the normal ao2_xxxx functions
that are named ao2_t_xxxx instead, with an extra argument, a string,
that will be printed out into /tmp/refs when the refcount for an
object is changed.

  these ao2_t_xxxx variants are provided:

ao2_t_alloc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
ao2_t_ref(arg1,arg2,arg3)
ao2_t_container_alloc(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
ao2_t_link(arg1, arg2, arg3)
ao2_t_unlink(arg1, arg2, arg3)
ao2_t_callback(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5) 
ao2_t_find(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
ao2_t_iterator_next(arg1, arg2)

If you study each argument list, you will see that these functions all have
one extra argument that their ao2_xxx counterpart. The last argument in
each case is supposed to be a string pointer, a "tag", that should contain
enough of an explanation, that you can pair operations that increment the 
ref count, with operations that are meant to decrement the refcount.

Each of these calls will generate at least one line of output in /tmp/refs.
These lines look like this:
...
0x8756f00 =1   chan_sip.c:22240:load_module (allocate users)
0x86e3408 =1   chan_sip.c:22241:load_module (allocate peers)
0x86dd380 =1   chan_sip.c:22242:load_module (allocate peers_by_ip)
0x822d020 =1   chan_sip.c:22243:load_module (allocate dialogs)
0x8930fd8 =1   chan_sip.c:20025:build_peer (allocate a peer struct)

0x8930218 +1   chan_sip.c:21539:reload_config (link peer into peers table) [@1]
0x868c040 -1   chan_sip.c:2424:dialog_unlink_all (unset the relatedpeer->call field in tandem with relatedpeer field itself) [@2]
0x868c040 -1   chan_sip.c:2443:dialog_unlink_all (Let's unbump the count in the unlink so the poor pvt can disappear if it is time) [@1]
0x868c040 **call destructor** chan_sip.c:2443:dialog_unlink_all (Let's unbump the count in the unlink so the poor pvt can disappear if it is time)
0x8cc07e8 -1   chan_sip.c:2370:unref_peer (unsetting a dialog relatedpeer field in sip_destroy) [@3]
0x8cc07e8 +1   chan_sip.c:3876:find_peer (ao2_find in peers table) [@2]
0x8cc07e8 -1   chan_sip.c:2370:unref_peer (unref_peer, from sip_devicestate, release ref from find_peer) [@3]
...

The first column is the object address. 
The second column reflects how the operation affected the ref count 
    for that object. Creation sets the ref count to 1 (=1). 
    increment or decrement and amount are specified (-1/+1).
The remainder of the line specifies where in the file the call was made,
    and the function name, and the tag supplied in the function call.

The **call destructor** is specified when the the destroy routine is
run for an object. It does not affect the ref count, but is important
in debugging, because it is possible to have the astobj2 system run it
multiple times on the same object, commonly fatal to asterisk.

Sometimes you have some helper functions to do object ref/unref
operations. Using these normally hides the place where these
functions were called. To get the location where these functions
were called to appear in /tmp/refs, you can do this sort of thing:

#ifdef REF_DEBUG
#define dialog_ref(arg1,arg2) dialog_ref_debug((arg1),(arg2), __FILE__, __LINE__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__)
#define dialog_unref(arg1,arg2) dialog_unref_debug((arg1),(arg2), __FILE__, __LINE__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__)
static struct sip_pvt *dialog_ref_debug(struct sip_pvt *p, char *tag, char *file, int line, const char *func)
{
	if (p)
		ao2_ref_debug(p, 1, tag, file, line, func);
	else
		ast_log(LOG_ERROR, "Attempt to Ref a null pointer\n");
	return p;
}

static struct sip_pvt *dialog_unref_debug(struct sip_pvt *p, char *tag, char *file, int line, const char *func)
{
	if (p)
		ao2_ref_debug(p, -1, tag, file, line, func);
	return NULL;
}
#else
static struct sip_pvt *dialog_ref(struct sip_pvt *p, char *tag)
{
	if (p)
		ao2_ref(p, 1);
	else
		ast_log(LOG_ERROR, "Attempt to Ref a null pointer\n");
	return p;
}

static struct sip_pvt *dialog_unref(struct sip_pvt *p, char *tag)
{
	if (p)
		ao2_ref(p, -1);
	return NULL;
}
#endif

In the above code, note that the "normal" helper funcs call ao2_ref() as
normal, and the "helper" functions call ao2_ref_debug directly with the 
file, function, and line number info provided. You might find this
well worth the effort to help track these function calls in the code.

To find out why objects are not destroyed (a common bug), you can 
edit the source file to use the ao2_t_* variants, add the #define REF_DEBUG 1 
before the #include "asterisk/astobj2.h" line, and add a descriptive 
tag to each call. Recompile, and run Asterisk, exit asterisk with
"stop gracefully", which should result in every object being destroyed.
Then, you can "sort -k 1 /tmp/refs > x1" to get a sorted list of
all the objects, or you can use "util/refcounter" to scan the file
for you and output any problems it finds.

The above may seem astronomically more work than it is worth to debug
reference counts, which may be true in "simple" situations, but for 
more complex situations, it is easily worth 100 times this effort to
help find problems.

To debug, pair all calls so that each call that increments the 
refcount is paired with a corresponding call that decrements the
count for the same reason. Hopefully, you will be left with one 
or more unpaired calls. This is where you start your search!

For instance, here is an example of this for a dialog object in 
chan_sip, that was not getting destroyed, after I moved the lines around
to pair operations:

   0x83787a0 =1   chan_sip.c:5733:sip_alloc (allocate a dialog(pvt) struct)
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:19173:sip_poke_peer (unref dialog at end of sip_poke_peer, obtained from sip_alloc, just before it goes out of scope) [@4]

   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:5854:sip_alloc (link pvt into dialogs table) [@1]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:19150:sip_poke_peer (About to change the callid -- remove the old name) [@3]
   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:19152:sip_poke_peer (Linking in under new name) [@2]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:2399:dialog_unlink_all (unlinking dialog via ao2_unlink) [@5]

   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:19130:sip_poke_peer (copy sip alloc from p to peer->call) [@2]


   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:2996:__sip_reliable_xmit (__sip_reliable_xmit: setting pkt->owner) [@3]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:2425:dialog_unlink_all (remove all current packets in this dialog, and the pointer to the dialog too as part of __sip_destroy) [@4]

   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:22356:unload_module (iterate thru dialogs) [@4]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:22359:unload_module (toss dialog ptr from iterator_next) [@5]


   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:22373:unload_module (iterate thru dialogs) [@3]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:22375:unload_module (throw away iterator result) [@2]

   0x83787a0 +1   chan_sip.c:2397:dialog_unlink_all (Let's bump the count in the unlink so it doesn't accidentally become dead before we are done) [@4]
   0x83787a0 -1   chan_sip.c:2436:dialog_unlink_all (Let's unbump the count in the unlink so the poor pvt can disappear if it is time) [@3]

As you can see, only one unbalanced operation is in the list, a ref count increment when
the peer->call was set, but no corresponding decrement was made...

Hopefully this helps you narrow your search and find those bugs.

THE ART OF REFERENCE COUNTING
(by Steve Murphy)
SOME TIPS for complicated code, and ref counting:

1. Theoretically, passing a refcounted object pointer into a function 
call is an act of copying the reference, and could be refcounted.
But, upon examination, this sort of refcounting will explode the amount
of code you have to enter, and for no tangible benefit, beyond
creating more possible failure points/bugs. It will even 
complicate your code and make debugging harder, slow down your program
doing useless increments and decrements of the ref counts.

2. It is better to track places where a ref counted pointer
is copied into a structure or stored. Make sure to decrement the refcount
of any previous pointer that might have been there, if setting
this field might erase a previous pointer. ao2_find and iterate_next
internally increment the ref count when they return a pointer, so 
you need to decrement the count before the pointer goes out of scope.

3. Any time you decrement a ref count, it may be possible that the
object will be destroyed (freed) immediately by that call. If you
are destroying a series of fields in a refcounted object, and 
any of the unref calls might possibly result in immediate destruction,
you can first increment the count to prevent such behavior, then 
after the last test, decrement the pointer to allow the object
to be destroyed, if the refcount would be zero.

Example:

	dialog_ref(dialog, "Let's bump the count in the unlink so it doesn't accidentally become dead before we are done");

	ao2_t_unlink(dialogs, dialog, "unlinking dialog via ao2_unlink");

	*//* Unlink us from the owner (channel) if we have one *//*
	if (dialog->owner) {
		if (lockowner)
			ast_channel_lock(dialog->owner);
		ast_debug(1, "Detaching from channel %s\n", dialog->owner->name);
		dialog->owner->tech_pvt = dialog_unref(dialog->owner->tech_pvt, "resetting channel dialog ptr in unlink_all");
		if (lockowner)
			ast_channel_unlock(dialog->owner);
	}
	if (dialog->registry) {
		if (dialog->registry->call == dialog)
			dialog->registry->call = dialog_unref(dialog->registry->call, "nulling out the registry's call dialog field in unlink_all");
		dialog->registry = registry_unref(dialog->registry, "delete dialog->registry");
	}
    ...
 	dialog_unref(dialog, "Let's unbump the count in the unlink so the poor pvt can disappear if it is time");
   
In the above code, the ao2_t_unlink could end up destroying the dialog
object; if this happens, then the subsequent usages of the dialog
pointer could result in a core dump. So, we 'bump' the
count upwards before beginning, and then decrementing the count when
we are finished. This is analogous to 'locking' or 'protecting' operations
for a short while.

4. One of the most insidious problems I've run into when converting
code to do ref counted automatic destruction, is in the destruction
routines. Where a "destroy" routine had previously been called to
get rid of an object in non-refcounted code, the new regime demands
that you tear that "destroy" routine into two pieces, one that will
tear down the links and 'unref' them, and the other to actually free
and reset fields. A destroy routine that does any reference deletion
for its own object, will never be called. Another insidious problem
occurs in mutually referenced structures. As an example, a dialog contains
a pointer to a peer, and a peer contains a pointer to a dialog. Watch
out that the destruction of one doesn't depend on the destruction of the
other, as in this case a dependency loop will result in neither being
destroyed!

Given the above, you should be ready to do a good job!

 \page AstObj2_Containers AstObj2 Containers

Containers are data structures meant to store several objects,
and perform various operations on them.
Internally, objects are stored in lists, hash tables or other
data structures depending on the needs.

\note NOTA BENE: at the moment the only container we support is the
	hash table and its degenerate form, the list.

Operations on container include:

  -  c = \b ao2_container_alloc(size, cmp_fn, hash_fn)
	allocate a container with desired size and default compare
	and hash function
         -The compare function returns an int, which
         can be 0 for not found, CMP_STOP to stop end a traversal,
         or CMP_MATCH if they are equal
         -The hash function returns an int. The hash function
         takes two argument, the object pointer and a flags field,

  -  \b ao2_find(c, arg, flags)
	returns zero or more element matching a given criteria
	(specified as arg). 'c' is the container pointer. Flags 
    can be:
	OBJ_UNLINK - to remove the object, once found, from the container.
	OBJ_NODATA - don't return the object if found (no ref count change)
	OBJ_MULTIPLE - don't stop at first match (not implemented)
	OBJ_POINTER	- if set, 'arg' is an object pointer, and a hashtable
                  search will be done. If not, a traversal is done.

  -  \b ao2_callback(c, flags, fn, arg)
	apply fn(obj, arg) to all objects in the container.
	Similar to find. fn() can tell when to stop, and
	do anything with the object including unlinking it.
	  - c is the container;
      - flags can be 
	     OBJ_UNLINK   - to remove the object, once found, from the container.
	     OBJ_NODATA   - don't return the object if found (no ref count change)
	     OBJ_MULTIPLE - don't stop at first match (not implemented)
	     OBJ_POINTER  - if set, 'arg' is an object pointer, and a hashtable
                        search will be done. If not, a traversal is done through
                        all the hashtable 'buckets'..
      - fn is a func that returns int, and takes 3 args: 
        (void *obj, void *arg, int flags);
          obj is an object
          arg is the same as arg passed into ao2_callback
          flags is the same as flags passed into ao2_callback
         fn returns:
           0: no match, keep going
           CMP_STOP: stop search, no match
           CMP_MATCH: This object is matched.

	Note that the entire operation is run with the container
	locked, so noone else can change its content while we work on it.
	However, we pay this with the fact that doing
	anything blocking in the callback keeps the container
	blocked.
	The mechanism is very flexible because the callback function fn()
	can do basically anything e.g. counting, deleting records, etc.
	possibly using arg to store the results.
   
  -  \b iterate on a container
	this is done with the following sequence

\code

	    struct ao2_container *c = ... // our container
	    struct ao2_iterator i;
	    void *o;

	    i = ao2_iterator_init(c, flags);
     
	    while ( (o = ao2_iterator_next(&i)) ) {
		... do something on o ...
		ao2_ref(o, -1);
	    }
\endcode

	The difference with the callback is that the control
	on how to iterate is left to us.

    - \b ao2_ref(c, -1)
	dropping a reference to a container destroys it, very simple!
 
Containers are ao2 objects themselves, and this is why their
implementation is simple too.

Before declaring containers, we need to declare the types of the
arguments passed to the constructor - in turn, this requires
to define callback and hash functions and their arguments.

/*! \brief
 * ao2_callback() is a generic function that applies cb_fn() to all objects
 * in a container, as described below.
 * 
 * \param c A pointer to the container to operate on.
 * \param flags A set of flags specifying the operation to perform,
	partially used by the container code, but also passed to
	the callback.
     - If OBJ_NODATA is set, ao2_callback will return NULL. No refcounts
       of any of the traversed objects will be incremented.
       On the converse, if it is NOT set (the default), The ref count
       of each object for which CMP_MATCH was set will be incremented,
       and you will have no way of knowing which those are, until
       the multiple-object-return functionality is implemented.
     - If OBJ_POINTER is set, the traversed items will be restricted
       to the objects in the bucket that the object key hashes to.
 * \param cb_fn A function pointer, that will be called on all
    objects, to see if they match. This function returns CMP_MATCH
    if the object is matches the criteria; CMP_STOP if the traversal
    should immediately stop, or both (via bitwise ORing), if you find a 
    match and want to end the traversal, and 0 if the object is not a match, 
    but the traversal should continue. This is the function that is applied
    to each object traversed. It's arguments are:
        (void *obj, void *arg, int flags), where:
          obj is an object
          arg is the same as arg passed into ao2_callback
          flags is the same as flags passed into ao2_callback (flags are
           also used by ao2_callback).
 * \param arg passed to the callback.
 * \return 	A pointer to the object found/marked, 
 * 		a pointer to a list of objects matching comparison function,
 * 		NULL if not found.
 *
 * If the function returns any objects, their refcount is incremented,
 * and the caller is in charge of decrementing them once done.
 * Also, in case of multiple values returned, the list used
 * to store the objects must be freed by the caller.
 *
 * Typically, ao2_callback() is used for two purposes:
 * - to perform some action (including removal from the container) on one
 *   or more objects; in this case, cb_fn() can modify the object itself,
 *   and to perform deletion should set CMP_MATCH on the matching objects,
 *   and have OBJ_UNLINK set in flags.
 * - to look for a specific object in a container; in this case, cb_fn()
 *   should not modify the object, but just return a combination of
 *   CMP_MATCH and CMP_STOP on the desired object.
 * Other usages are also possible, of course.

 * This function searches through a container and performs operations
 * on objects according on flags passed.
 * XXX describe better
 * The comparison is done calling the compare function set implicitly. 
 * The p pointer can be a pointer to an object or to a key, 
 * we can say this looking at flags value.
 * If p points to an object we will search for the object pointed
 * by this value, otherwise we serch for a key value.
 * If the key is not uniq we only find the first matching valued.
 * If we use the OBJ_MARK flags, we mark all the objects matching 
 * the condition.
 *
 * The use of flags argument is the follow:
 *
 *	OBJ_UNLINK 		unlinks the object found
 *	OBJ_NODATA		on match, do return an object
 *				Callbacks use OBJ_NODATA as a default
 *				functions such as find() do
 *	OBJ_MULTIPLE		return multiple matches
 *				Default for _find() is no.
 *				to a key (not yet supported)
 *	OBJ_POINTER 		the pointer is an object pointer
 *
 * In case we return a list, the callee must take care to destroy 
 * that list when no longer used.
 *
 * \note When the returned object is no longer in use, ao2_ref() should
 * be used to free the additional reference possibly created by this function.

/*! \brief
 *
 *
 * When we need to walk through a container, we use
 * ao2_iterator to keep track of the current position.
 * 
 * Because the navigation is typically done without holding the
 * lock on the container across the loop,
 * objects can be inserted or deleted or moved
 * while we work. As a consequence, there is no guarantee that
 * the we manage to touch all the elements on the list, or it
 * is possible that we touch the same object multiple times.
 * However, within the current hash table container, the following is true:
 *  - It is not possible to miss an object in the container while iterating
 *    unless it gets added after the iteration begins and is added to a bucket
 *    that is before the one the current object is in.  In this case, even if
 *    you locked the container around the entire iteration loop, you still would
 *    not see this object, because it would still be waiting on the container
 *    lock so that it can be added.
 *  - It would be extremely rare to see an object twice.  The only way this can
 *    happen is if an object got unlinked from the container and added again 
 *    during the same iteration.  Furthermore, when the object gets added back,
 *    it has to be in the current or later bucket for it to be seen again.
 *
 * An iterator must be first initialized with ao2_iterator_init(),
 * then we can use o = ao2_iterator_next() to move from one
 * element to the next. Remember that the object returned by
 * ao2_iterator_next() has its refcount incremented,
 * and the reference must be explicitly released when done with it.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  \code
 *
 *  struct ao2_container *c = ... // the container we want to iterate on
 *  struct ao2_iterator i;
 *  struct my_obj *o;
 *
 *  i = ao2_iterator_init(c, flags);
 *
 *  while ( (o = ao2_iterator_next(&i)) ) {
 *     ... do something on o ...
 *     ao2_ref(o, -1);
 *  }
 *
 *  \endcode
 *

/*! \brief 
 * The Astobj2 iterator
 *
 * \note You are not supposed to know the internals of an iterator!
 * We would like the iterator to be opaque, unfortunately
 * its size needs to be known if we want to store it around
 * without too much trouble.
 * Anyways...
 * The iterator has a pointer to the container, and a flags
 * field specifying various things e.g. whether the container
 * should be locked or not while navigating on it.
 * The iterator "points" to the current object, which is identified
 * by three values:
 *
 * - a bucket number;
 * - the object_id, which is also the container version number
 *   when the object was inserted. This identifies the object
 *   univoquely, however reaching the desired object requires
 *   scanning a list.
 * - a pointer, and a container version when we saved the pointer.
 *   If the container has not changed its version number, then we
 *   can safely follow the pointer to reach the object in constant time.
 *
 * Details are in the implementation of ao2_iterator_next()
 * A freshly-initialized iterator has bucket=0, version = 0.
