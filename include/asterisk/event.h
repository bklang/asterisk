 * \brief Generic event system
 *
 * The purpose of this API is to provide a generic way to share events between
 * Asterisk modules.  Code can generate events, and other code can subscribe to
 * them.
 *
 * Events have an associated event type, as well as information elements.  The
 * information elements are the meta data that go along with each event.  For
 * example, in the case of message waiting indication, the event type is MWI,
 * and each MWI event containts at least three information elements: the
 * mailbox, the number of new messages, and the number of old messages.
 *
 * Subscriptions to events consist of an event type and information elements,
 * as well.  Subscriptions can be to all events, or a certain subset of events.
 * If an event type is provided, only events of that type will be sent to this
 * subscriber.  Furthermore, if information elements are supplied with the
 * subscription, only events that contain the specified information elements
 * with specified values will be sent to the subscriber.  For example, when a
 * SIP phone subscribes to MWI for mailbox 1234, then chan_sip can subscribe
 * to internal Asterisk MWI events with the MAILBOX information element with
 * a value of "1234".
 *
 * Another key feature of this event system is the ability to cache events.
 * It is useful for some types of events to be able to remember the last known
 * value.  These are usually events that indicate some kind of state change.
 * In the example of MWI, app_voicemail can instruct the event core to cache
 * these events based on the mailbox.  So, the last known MWI state of each
 * mailbox will be cached, and other modules can retrieve this information
 * on demand without having to poll the mailbox directly.

 * \brief Subscribe to events
 *
 * \param event_type The type of events to subscribe to
 * \param cb The function to be called with events
 * \param userdata data to be passed to the event callback
 *
 * The rest of the arguments to this function specify additional parameters for
 * the subscription to filter which events are passed to this subscriber.  The
 * arguments must be in sets of:
 * \code
 *    <enum ast_event_ie_type>, [enum ast_event_ie_pltype, [payload] ]
 * \endcode
 * and must end with AST_EVENT_IE_END.
 *
 * If the ie_type specified is *not* AST_EVENT_IE_END, then it must be followed
 * by a valid IE payload type.  If the payload type specified is
 * AST_EVENT_IE_PLTYPE_EXISTS, then the 3rd argument should not be provided.
 * Otherwise, a payload must also be specified.
 *
 * \return This returns a reference to the subscription for use with
 *         un-subscribing later.  If there is a failure in creating the
 *         subscription, NULL will be returned.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * \code
 * peer->mwi_event_sub = ast_event_subscribe(AST_EVENT_MWI, mwi_event_cb, peer,
 *     AST_EVENT_IE_MAILBOX, AST_EVENT_IE_PLTYPE_STR, peer->mailbox,
 *     AST_EVENT_IE_END);
 * \endcode
 *
 * This creates a subscription to AST_EVENT_MWI events that contain an
 * information element, AST_EVENT_IE_MAILBOX, with the same string value
 * contained in peer->mailbox.  Also, the event callback will be passed a
 * pointer to the peer.
