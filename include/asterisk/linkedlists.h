  \brief Defines a structure to be used to hold a list of specified type.

  This macro creates a structure definition that can be used
  to hold a list of the entries of type \a type. It does not actually
  declare (allocate) a structure; to do that, either follow this
  macro with the desired name of the instance you wish to declare,
  or use the specified \a name to declare instances elsewhere.

  Example usage:
  \code
  static AST_LIST_HEAD(entry_list, entry) entries;
  \endcode

  This would define \c struct \c entry_list, and declare an instance of it named
  \a entries, all intended to hold a list of type \c struct \c entry.

  \param field This is the name of the field (declared using AST_LIST_ENTRY())
  used to link entries of this list together.

  This macro is use to loop over (traverse) the entries in a list. It uses a
  \a for loop, and supplies the enclosed code with a pointer to each list
  entry as it loops. It is typically used as follows:
  \code
  static AST_LIST_HEAD(entry_list, list_entry) entries;
  ...
  struct list_entry {
  	...
  	AST_LIST_ENTRY(list_entry) list;
  }

     (do something with current here)
  }
  \endcode
  \warning If you modify the forward-link pointer contained in the \a current entry while
  inside the loop, the behavior will be unpredictable. At a minimum, the following
  macros will modify the forward-link pointer, and should not be used inside
  AST_LIST_TRAVERSE() against the entry pointed to by the \a current pointer without
  careful consideration of their consequences:
  \li AST_LIST_NEXT() (when used as an lvalue)
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_AFTER()
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_HEAD()
  \li AST_LIST_INSERT_TAIL()
