/*! \page CLI_command_api CLI command API

   CLI commands are described by a struct ast_cli_entry that contains
   all the components for their implementation.

   In the "old-style" format, the record must contain:
   - a NULL-terminated array of words constituting the command, e.g.
	{ "set", "debug", "on", NULL },
   - a summary string (short) and a usage string (longer);
   - a handler which implements the command itself, invoked with
     a file descriptor and argc/argv as typed by the user
   - a 'generator' function which, given a partial string, can
     generate legal completions for it.
   An example is

	int old_setdebug(int fd, int argc, char *argv[]);
	char *dbg_complete(const char *line, const char *word, int pos, int n);

	{ { "set", "debug", "on", NULL }, do_setdebug, "Enable debugging",
	set_debug_usage, dbg_complete },

   In the "new-style" format, all the above functionalities are implemented
   by a single function, and the arguments tell which output is required.

   \note \b Note: ideally, the new-style handler would have a different prototype,
   i.e. something like

	int new_setdebug(const struct ast_cli *e, int function,
	    int fd, int argc, char *argv[],	// handler args
	    int n, int pos, const char *line, const char *word // -complete args)

   but at this moment we want to help the transition from old-style to new-style
   functions so we keep the same interface and override some of the traditional
   arguments.

   To help the transition, a new-style entry has the same interface as the old one,
   but it is declared as follows:

	int new_setdebug(int fd, int argc, char *argv[]);

	...
	/* this is how we create the entry to register */
	NEW_CLI(new_setdebug, "short description")
	...

   Called with the default arguments (argc > 0), the new_handler implements
   the command as before.
   A negative argc indicates one of the other functions, namely
   generate the usage string, the full command, or implement the generator.
   As a trick to extend the interface while being backward compatible,
   argv[-1] points to a struct ast_cli_args, and, for the generator,
   argv[0] is really a pointer to a struct ast_cli_args.
   The return string is obtained by casting the result to char *

   An example of new-style handler is the following

\code
static int test_new_cli(int fd, int argc, char *argv[])
{
        struct ast_cli_entry *e = (struct ast_cli_entry *)argv[-1];
        struct ast_cli_args *a;
	static char *choices = { "one", "two", "three", NULL };

        switch(argc) {
        case CLI_USAGE:
                return (int)
			"Usage: do this well <arg>\n"
			"	typically multiline with body indented\n";

        case CLI_CMD_STRING:
                return (int)"do this well";

        case CLI_GENERATE:
                a = (struct ast_cli_args *)argv[0];
                if (a->pos > e->args)
                        return NULL;
        	return ast_cli_complete(a->word, choices, a->n);

        default:        
                // we are guaranteed to be called with argc >= e->args;
                if (argc > e->args + 1) // we accept one extra argument
                        return RESULT_SHOWUSAGE;
                ast_cli(fd, "done this well for %s\n", e->args[argc-1]);
                return RESULT_SUCCESS;
        }
}

\endcode
