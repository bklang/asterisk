 * \page AstThreadStorage The Asterisk Thread Storage API
 *
 *
 * The POSIX threads (pthreads) API provides the ability to define thread
 * specific data.  The functions and structures defined here are intended
 * to centralize the code that is commonly used when using thread local
 * storage.
 *
 * The motivation for using this code in Asterisk is for situations where
 * storing data on a thread-specific basis can provide some amount of
 * performance benefit.  For example, there are some call types in Asterisk
 * where ast_frame structures must be allocated very rapidly (easily 50, 100,
 * 200 times a second).  Instead of doing the equivalent of that many calls
 * to malloc() and free() per second, thread local storage is used to keep a
 * list of unused frame structures so that they can be continuously reused.
