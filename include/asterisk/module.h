/*! \page ModMngmnt The Asterisk Module management interface
 * \par The following is part of the new module management code.
 *
 * All modules must implement the module API (load, unload...)
 * whose functions are exported through fields of a "struct module_symbol";
 *
 * Modules exporting extra symbols (data or functions), should list
 * them into an array of struct symbol_entry: \r
 *     struct symbol_entry exported_symbols[]
 * \r
 * of symbols, with a NULL name on the last entry
 *
 * Functions should be added with MOD_FUNC(name),
 * data structures with MOD_DATA(_name).
 * The array in turn is referenced by struct module_symbol.
 * (Typically, a module will export only a single symbol, which points
 * to a record containing all the methods. This is the API of the module,
 * and should be known to the module's clients as well.
 *
 * \par Connections to symbols in other modules
 * Modules that require symbols supplied by other modules should
 * provide an array
 *     struct symbol_entry required_symbols[]
 * of symbols, with a NULL name on the last entry, containing the
 * name of the desired symbol.
 * For good measure, we also provide the size in both caller and calle
 * to figure out if there is a mismatch (not terribly useful because most
 * objects are a single word, but still... )
 * The symbol can be added to the array with MOD_WANT(symbol) macro.
 * required_symbols is also pointed by through struct module_symbol.
 *
 * Typically, the whole interface exported by a module should be
 * in a single structure named after the module, as follows.
 * Say the module high level name is 'foo', then we should have
 * - in include/asterisk/foo.h
 *     struct foo_interface {
 *		int (*f)(int, char *); -- first function exported 
 *		const char (*g)(int); -- second function exported 
 *		char *buf;
 *		...		-- other fields
 *     }
 * - in the module exporting the interface, e.g. res/res_foo.c
 *	static int f(int, char *);
 *	static const char *g(int);
 *	const char buf[BUFSZ];
 *     struct foo_interface foo = {
 *	.f = f,
 *	.g = g,
 *	.buf = buf,
 *     }
 *
 * \note NOTE: symbol names are 'global' in this module namespace, so it
 * will be wiser to name exported symbols with a prefix indicating the module
 * supplying it, e.g. foo_f, foo_g, foo_buf. Internally to the module,
 * symbols are still static so they can keep short and meaningful names.
 * The macros MOD_FIELD and METHOD_BASE() below help setting these entries.
 *
 *	MOD_FIELD(f1),		-- field and function name are the same
 *	METHOD_BASE(foo_, f1),  -- field and function name differ by a prefix
 *	.f1 = function_name,    -- generic case
 *     }
 *
 * Note that the loader requires that no fields of exported_symbols
 * are NULL, because that is used as an indication of the end of the array.
 *
 * \par Module states
 * Modules can be in a number of different states, as below:
 * - \b MS_FAILED    attempt to load failed. This is final.
 * - \b MS_NEW       just added to the list, symbols unresolved.
 * - \b MS_RESOLVED  all symbols resolved, but supplier modules not active yet.
 * - \b MS_CANLOAD   all symbols resolved and suppliers are all active
 *              (or we are in a cyclic dependency and we are breaking a loop)
 * - \b MS_ACTIVE    load() returned successfully.
 *
 * 
 * \par Module Types
 * For backward compatibility, we have 3 types of loadable modules:
 *
 * - \b MOD_0 these are the 'old style' modules, which export a number
 *       of callbacks, and their full interface, as globally visible
 *       symbols. The module needs to be loaded with RTLD_LAZY and
 *       RTLD_GLOBAL to make symbols visible to other modules, and
 *       to avoid load failures due to cross dependencies.
 *
 * - \b MOD_1 almost as above, but the generic callbacks are all into a
 *       a structure, mod_data. Same load requirements as above.
 *
 * - \b MOD_2 this is the 'new style' format for modules. The module must
 *       explictly declare which simbols are exported and which
 *       symbols from other modules are used, and the code in this
 *       loader will implement appropriate checks to load the modules
 *       in the correct order. Also this allows to load modules
 *       with RTLD_NOW and RTLD_LOCAL so there is no chance of run-time
 *       bugs due to unresolved symbols or name conflicts.
