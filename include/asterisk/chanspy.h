  due to mismatched queue lengths, or if the spy structure is configured to return
  unmixed audio (in which case each call to this function will return a frame of audio
  from each side of channel).

  this function. You must <b>not</b> hold the channel's lock at the same time.

  \brief Efficiently wait until audio is available for a spy, or an exception occurs.
  \param spy The spy to wait on
  \return nothing

  Note: The locking rules for this function are non-obvious... first, you must <b>not</b>
  hold the channel's lock when calling this function. Second, you must hold the spy's lock
  before making the function call; while the function runs the lock will be released, and
  when the trigger event occurs, the lock will be re-obtained. This means that when control
  returns to your code, you will again hold the spy's lock.
