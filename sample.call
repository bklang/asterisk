#
# This is a sample file that can be dumped in /var/spool/asterisk/outgoing
# to generate a call.  Obviously, you MUST specify at least a channel in
# the same format as you would for the "Dial" application.  Only one
# channel name is permitted.
#
Channel: Zap/1
#
# You may also specify a wait time (default is 45 seconds) for how long to
# wait for the channel to be answered, a retry time (default is 5 mins)
# for how soon to retry this call, and a maximum number of retries (default
# is 0) for how many times to retry this call.
#
MaxRetries: 2
RetryTime: 60
WaitTime: 30

#
# Once the call is answered, you must provide either an application/data
# combination, or a context/extension/priority in which to start the PBX.
#
Context: default
Extension: s
Priority: 1

#
# Alternatively you can specify just an application
# and its arguments to be run, instead of a context
# extension and priority
#
#Application: VoiceMailMain
#Data: 1234

#
# You can set the callerid that will be used for the outgoing call
#
#Callerid: Wakeup Call Service <(555) 555-5555>

#
# You can set channel variables that will be passed to the channel
#
#SetVar: file1=/tmp/to
#SetVar: file2=/tmp/msg
#SetVar: timestamp=20021023104500
